While the performance of this approach is computationally bounded, implementations of direct trajectory optimization that use iterative methods to solve the underlying moderately-large and sparse linear systems, are a natural fit for parallel hardware acceleration. In this work, we introduce MPCGPU, a GPU-accelerated, real-time NMPC solver that leverages an accelerated preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) linear system solver at its core. We show that MPCGPU increases the scalability and real-time performance of NMPC, solving larger problems, at faster rates. In particular, for tracking tasks using the Kuka IIWA manipulator, MPCGPU is able to scale to kilohertz control rates with trajectories as long as 512 knot points. This is driven by a custom PCG solver which outperforms state-of-the-art, CPU-based, linear system solvers by at least 10x for a majority of solves and 3.6x on average.},

Unfortunately, current large-scale sketching algorithms show poor memory-accuracy trade-off in selecting features in high dimensions due to the irreversible collision and accumulation of the stochastic gradient noise in the sketched domain. Here, we develop a second-order feature selection algorithm, called BEAR, which avoids the extra collisions by efficiently storing the second-order stochastic gradients of the celebrated Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shannon (BFGS) algorithm in Count Sketch, using a memory cost that grows sublinearly with the size of the feature vector. BEAR reveals an unexplored advantage of second-order optimization for memory-constrained high-dimensional gradient sketching. Our extensive experiments on several real-world data sets from genomics to language processing demonstrate that BEAR requires up to three orders of magnitude less memory space to achieve the same classification accuracy compared to the first-order sketching algorithms with a comparable run time. Our theoretical analysis further proves the global convergence of BEAR with (1/{$t$})O(1/t){\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1/t) rate in {$t$}tt iterations of the sketched algorithm.},

Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than \$20{\textbackslash}\%\$ and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than \$30{\textbackslash}\%\$.},

  abstract = {We present a method for optimal control of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) with uncertain parameter fields. We consider an objective function that involves the mean and variance of the control objective, leading to a risk-averse optimal control problem. To make the problem tractable, we invoke a quadratic Taylor series approximation of the control objective with respect to the uncertain parameter. This enables deriving explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the control objective in terms of its gradients and Hessians with respect to the uncertain parameter. The risk-averse optimal control problem is then formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem with constraints given by the forward and adjoint PDEs defining these gradients and Hessians. The expressions for the mean and variance of the control objective under the quadratic approximation involve the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian and are thus prohibitive to evaluate. To address this, we employ trace estimators that only require a modest number of Hessian-vector products. We illustrate our approach with two problems: the control of a semilinear elliptic PDE with an uncertain boundary source term, and the control of a linear elliptic PDE with an uncertain coefficient field. For the latter problem, we derive adjoint-based expressions for efficient computation of the gradient of the risk-averse objective with respect to the controls. Our method ensures that the cost of computing the risk-averse objective and its gradient with respect to the control, measured in the number of PDE solves, is independent of the (discretized) parameter and control dimensions, and depends only on the number of random vectors employed in the trace estimation. Finally, we present a comprehensive numerical study of an optimal control problem for fluid flow in a porous medium with uncertain permeability field.},

  abstract = {Large-scale optimization of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is a frontier problem in scientific computation. Reduced quasi-Newton sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are state-of-the-art approaches for such problems. These methods take full advantage of existing PDE solver technology and parallelize well. However, their algorithmic scalability is questionable; for certain problem classes they can be very slow to converge. In this two-part article we propose a new method for steady-state PDE-constrained optimization, based on the idea of using a full space Newton solver combined with an approximate reduced space quasi-Newton SQP preconditioner. The basic components of the method are Newton solution of the first-order optimality conditions that characterize stationarity of the Lagrangian function; Krylov solution of the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) linear systems arising at each Newton iteration using a symmetric quasi-minimum residual method; preconditioning of the KKT system using an approximate state/decision variable decomposition that replaces the forward PDE Jacobians by their own preconditioners, and the decision space Schur complement (the reduced Hessian) by a BFGS approximation initialized by a two-step stationary method. Accordingly, we term the new method \{{\textbackslash}it Lagrange--Newton--Krylov--Schur\} (LNKS). It is fully parallelizable, exploits the structure of available parallel algorithms for the PDE forward problem, and is locally quadratically convergent. In part I of this two-part article, we investigate the effectiveness of the KKT linear system solver. We test our method on two optimal control problems in which the state constraints are described by the steady-state Stokes equations. The objective is to minimize dissipation or the deviation from a given velocity field; the control variables are the boundary velocities. Numerical experiments on up to 256 Cray T3E processors and on an SGI Origin 2000 include scalability and performance assessment of the LNKS algorithm and comparisons with reduced SQP for up to \$1,000,000\$ state and50,000 decision variables. In part II of the article, we address globalization and inexactness issues, and apply LNKS to the optimal control of the steady incompressible Navier--Stokes equations.},

Herein, a general algorithmic framework entitled Detection of Communities for Optimization Decomposition (DeCODe) is presented. DeCODe uses community detection, a concept originating from network theory, to generate optimization subproblems which are strongly interacting within individual subproblems but weakly interacting between different ones. The importance of communities in solving problems using decomposition solution methods is showcased via a least squares regression problem. The ability of DeCODe to identify nontrivial decompositions of optimization problems is demonstrated through a large renewable energy and chemical production optimal design problem and two mixed integer nonlinear program test problems.},

  abstract = {Randomized algorithms for the generation of low rank approximations of large dense matrices have become popular methods in scientific computing and machine learning. In this paper, we extend the scope of these methods and present batched GPU randomized algorithms for the efficient generation of low rank representations of large sets of small dense matrices, as well as their generalization to the construction of hierarchically low rank symmetric \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ matrices with general partitioning structures. In both cases, the algorithms need to access the matrices only through matrix-vector multiplication operations which can be done in blocks to increase the arithmetic intensity and substantially boost the resulting performance. The batched GPU kernels are adaptive, allow nonuniform sizes in the matrices of the batch, and are more effective than SVD factorizations on matrices with fast decaying spectra.  The hierarchical matrix generation consists of two phases, interleaved at every level of the matrix hierarchy. A first phase adaptively generates low rank approximations of matrix blocks through randomized matrix-vector sampling. A second phase accumulates and compresses these blocks into a hierarchical matrix that is incrementally constructed. The accumulation expresses the low rank blocks of a given level as a set of local low rank updates that are performed simultaneously on the whole matrix allowing high-performance batched kernels to be used in the compression operations. When the ranks of the blocks generated in the first phase are too large to be processed in a single operation, the low rank updates can be split into smaller-sized updates and applied in sequence. Assuming representative rank \$k\$, the resulting matrix has optimal \$O(kN)\$ asymptotic storage complexity because of the nested bases it uses. The ability to generate an \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ matrix from matrix-vector products allows us to support a general randomized matrix-matrix multiplication operation, an important kernel in hierarchical matrix computations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high performance of the algorithms and their effectiveness in generating hierarchical matrices to a desired target accuracy.},

  abstract = {Over the past fifteen years, the implementation of the minimum degree algorithm has received much study, and many important enhancements have been made to it. This paper describes these various enhancements, their historical development, and some experiments showing how very effective they are in improving the execution time of the algorithm. A shortcoming is also presented that exists in all of the widely used implementations of the algorithm, namely, that the quality of the ordering provided by the implementations is surprisingly sensitive to the initial ordering. For example, changing the input ordering can lead to an increase (or decrease) of as much as a factor of three in the cost of the subsequent numerical factorization. This sensitivity is caused by the lack of an effective tie-breaking strategy, and the authors' experiments illustrate the importance of developing such a strategy}

These layers encode constraints and complex dependencies between the hidden states that traditional convolutional and fully-connected layers often cannot capture. In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.},

It explores linear optimal control theory from an engineering viewpoint, with step-by-step explanations that show clearly how to make practical use of the material.The three-part treatment begins with the basic theory of the linear regulator/tracker for time-invariant and time-varying systems. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is introduced using the Principle of Optimality, and the infinite-time problem is considered. The second part outlines the engineering properties of the regulator. Topics include degree of stability, phase and gain margin, tolerance of time delay, effect of nonlinearities, asymptotic properties, and various sensitivity problems. The third section explores state estimation and robust controller design using state-estimate feedback. Numerous examples emphasize the issues related to consistent and accurate system design. Key topics include loop-recovery techniques, frequency shaping, and controller reduction, for both scalar and multivariable systems. Self-contained appendixes cover matrix theory, linear systems, the Pontryagin minimum principle, Lyapunov stability, and the Riccati equation. Newly added to this Dover edition is a complete solutions manual for the problems appearing at the conclusion of each section.},

  abstract = {Mathematical programs with equilibrium (or complementarity) constraints (MPECs) form a difficult class of optimization problems. The feasible set has a very special structure and violates most of the standard constraint qualifications. Therefore, one typically applies specialized algorithms in order to solve MPECs. One very prominent class of specialized algorithms are the regularization (or relaxation) methods. The first regularization method for MPECs is due to Scholtes [SIAM J. Optim., 11 (2001), pp. 918--936], but in the meantime, there exist a number of different regularization schemes which try to relax the difficult constraints in different ways. However, almost all regularization methods converge to C-stationary points only, which is a very weak stationarity concept. An exception is a recent method by Kadrani, Dussault, and Benchakroun [SIAM J. Optim., 20 (2009), pp. 78--103], whose limit points are shown to be M-stationary. Here we provide a new regularization method which also converges to M-stationary points. The assumptions to prove this result are, in principle, significantly weaker than for all other relaxation schemes. Furthermore, our relaxed problem has a much more favorable geometric shape than the one proposed by Kadrani, Dussault, and Benchakroun.},

In addition, it can scale to very large problems because its core operation is matrix-vector multiplications. PDLP is derived by applying the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method, popularized by Chambolle and Pock (2011), to a saddle-point formulation of LP. PDLP enhances PDHG for LP by combining several new techniques with older tricks from the literature; the enhancements include diagonal preconditioning, presolving, adaptive step sizes, and adaptive restarting. PDLP improves the state of the art for first-order methods applied to LP. We compare PDLP with SCS, an ADMM-based solver, on a set of 383 LP instances derived from MIPLIB 2017. With a target of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-8\}\$ relative accuracy and 1 hour time limit, PDLP achieves a 6.3x reduction in the geometric mean of solve times and a 4.6x reduction in the number of instances unsolved (from 227 to 49). Furthermore, we highlight standard benchmark instances and a large-scale application (PageRank) where our open-source prototype of PDLP, written in Julia, outperforms a commercial LP solver.},

  abstract = {The optimal power-flow problem is central to many tasks in the design and operation of electric power grids. This problem seeks the minimum-cost operating point for an electric power grid while satisfying both engineering requirements and physical laws describing how power travels through the electric network. By additionally considering the possibility of component failures and using an accurate alternating current (AC) power-flow model of the electric network, the security-constrained AC optimal power flow (SC-AC-OPF) problem is of paramount practical relevance. To assess recent progress in solution algorithms for SC-AC-OPF problems and spur new innovations, the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy organized Challenge 1 of the Grid Optimization (GO) competition. This special issue includes papers authored by the top three teams in Challenge 1 of the GO Competition (Teams gollnlp, GO-SNIP, and GMI-GO). To introduce these papers and provide context about the competition, this paper describes the SC-AC-OPF problem formulation used in the competition, overviews historical developments and the state of the art in SC-AC-OPF algorithms, discusses the competition, and summarizes the algorithms used by these three teams.

The local optima that result from the TS are fine-tuned with NMDS to reduce the required number of simulations. The tool has been applied to find the total refrigerant flow rate, composition and the refrigerant suction and condenser pressures that minimize the energy requirements of a Prico process. The main strength of this method is that it has a high probability of obtaining a better solution with significantly fewer simulation runs than other metaheuristic methods. Also, by changing the TS step size it is possible to influence the initial search pattern, thereby taking advantage of already gained process knowledge to decrease the optimization time. The method is general and can be applied to other processes modelled in Aspen HYSYS.},

One such example is process and control optimization for lithium-ion batteries during materials selection, cell manufacturing and operation. A typical objective is to maximize battery~lifetime;~however, conducting even a single experiment to evaluate lifetime can take months to years3--5. Furthermore,~both~large parameter spaces and high sampling variability3,6,7 necessitate~a large number of~experiments. Hence, the key challenge is to reduce both the number and the duration of the experiments required. Here we develop and demonstrate a machine learning methodology ~to efficiently optimize a parameter space specifying the current and voltage profiles of six-step, ten-minute fast-charging protocols for maximizing battery cycle life, which~can~alleviate range anxiety for electric-vehicle users8,9. We combine two key elements to reduce the optimization cost: an~early-prediction~model5, which reduces the time per experiment by predicting the final cycle life using data from the first few cycles, and a Bayesian optimization algorithm10,11, which reduces the number of experiments by balancing exploration and exploitation to efficiently probe the parameter space of charging protocols. Using this methodology, we rapidly identify high-cycle-life charging protocols among 224 candidates in 16 days (compared with over 500 days using exhaustive search without early prediction), and subsequently validate~the accuracy and efficiency of our optimization approach. Our closed-loop methodology automatically incorporates feedback from past experiments to inform future decisions and can be generalized to other applications in battery design and, more broadly, other scientific domains that involve time-intensive experiments and multi-dimensional design spaces.},

Consequently, benchmarking studies using the seminal AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem have emerged as the primary method for evaluating these emerging methods. However, it is often difficult to directly compare these studies due to subtle differences in the AC-OPF problem formulation as well as the network, generation, and loading data that are used for evaluation. To help address these challenges, this IEEE PES Task Force report proposes a standardized AC-OPF mathematical formulation and the PGLib-OPF networks for benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms. A motivating study demonstrates some limitations of the established network datasets in the context of benchmarking AC-OPF algorithms and a validation study demonstrates the efficacy of using the PGLib-OPF networks for this purpose. In the interest of scientific discourse and future additions, the PGLib-OPF benchmark library is open-access and all the of network data is provided under a creative commons license.},

Towards these ends, we provide the first polynomial time algorithm for learning a linear dynamical system from a polynomial length trajectory up to polynomial error in the system parameters under essentially minimal assumptions: observability, controllability, and marginal stability. Our algorithm is built on a method of moments estimator to directly estimate Markov parameters from which the dynamics can be extracted. Furthermore, we provide statistical lower bounds when our observability and controllability assumptions are violated.},

  abstract = {Demand-side flexibility is an important tool for enhancing the interaction of renewable energy resources and reducing the need for grid upgrades. To employ this flexibility as a market product, it is necessary to aggregate and coordinate by coordinating responsive loads. In this regard, designing effective load coordination mechanisms that consider the preferences of aggregators, end-users, and network operators is critical for the successful implementation of demand response (DR) programs. This paper proposes an incentive-based method for coordinating a group of controllable devices that is practical, does not require complex, high-order models of the entire system, respects end-users privacy and quality of service (QoS), and can readily incorporate network conditions to ensure grid reliability. The proposed method includes algorithms at both the end-user level for controllable device operation and the aggregator level for managing the grid access requests. These algorithms are fast and with low computational burden which makes them suitable for the designed framework, reduces the implementation cost and increases the chance of scalability. The method is illustrated with a realistic test system consisting of a set of controllable heat pumps used in pool heating systems and uncontrollable loads placed in a distribution feeder and supplied by a distribution substation transformer. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in satisfying the controllable device, end-users, and grid constraints. Comparing the results with similar existing methods shows that the method is 11\% more cost-effective than traditional ON/OFF methods while reducing the number of rejected grid access requests from the devices, significantly.},

It is designed to support many different SQP algorithms and to allow for extern al configur at ion of application-specific linear algebra objects such as matrices and linear solvers. In addition, it is possible for a client to modify the SQP algorithms to meet other specialized needs without having to touch any of th e source code within the rSQP++ framework or even having to recompile existing SQP algorithms. Much of this is accomplished through a set of carefully constructed interfaces to various linear algebra objects such as matrices and linear solvers. The initial development of rSQP++ was done in a serial environment and therefore issues related to the use of massively parallel iterative solvers used in PDE-constrained optimization have not yet been addressed. In order to more effectively support parallelism, rSQP++ needs the addition and integration of an abstract vector interface to allow more flexibility in vector implementations. Encapsulating vectors away from algorithmic code would allow fully parallel linear algebra, but could also greatly restrict the kinds of operations that need to be performed. The difficulty in developing an abstract vector interface and a proposed design for a remedy are discussed.},

In particular, we provide a case under which a simplified model, compared to a detailed one, results in a decrease in profit of 1.8\% and hydrogen production of 13.5\% over a year. The key lesson learned is that a detailed model potentially earns a higher profit in circumstances under which the electrolyzer operates with partial loading.

  abstract = {The response of a model microelectrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The ``weakly nonlinear'' limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter {$\varepsilon$}={$\lambda$}D/L, where {$\lambda$}D is the screening length and L the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of {$\lambda$}DL/D (not {$\lambda$}2D/D), where D is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduces multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, L2/D. In the ``strongly nonlinear'' regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multicomponent electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

  abstract = {Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for nonlinear system identification has proven to be a promising approach, but despite of all recent research efforts, many practical and theoretical problems still remain open. Specifically, noise handling and models, issues of consistency and reliable estimation under minimization of the prediction error are the most severe problems. The latter comes with numerous practical challenges such as explosion of the computational cost in terms of the number of data samples and the occurrence of instabilities during optimization. In this paper, we aim to overcome these issues by proposing a method which uses a truncated prediction loss and a subspace encoder for state estimation. The truncated prediction loss is computed by selecting multiple truncated subsections from the time series and computing the average prediction loss. To obtain a computationally efficient estimation method that minimizes the truncated prediction loss, a subspace encoder represented by an artificial neural network is introduced. This encoder aims to approximate the state reconstructability map of the estimated model to provide an initial state for each truncated subsection given past inputs and outputs. By theoretical analysis, we show that, under mild conditions, the proposed method is locally consistent, increases optimization stability, and achieves increased data efficiency by allowing for overlap between the subsections. Lastly, we provide practical insights and user guidelines employing a numerical example and state-of-the-art benchmark results.},

Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language. We evaluate our approach by adding support for NVIDIA GPUs to the Julia programming language. By integrating with the existing compiler, we significantly lower the cost to implement and maintain the new compiler, and facilitate reuse of existing application code. Moreover, use of the high-level Julia programming language enables new and dynamic approaches for GPU programming. This greatly improves programmer productivity, while maintaining application performance similar to that of the official NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.},

  abstract = {Policy gradients methods apply to complex, poorly understood, control problems by performing stochastic gradient descent over a parameterized class of polices. Unfortunately, even for simple control problems solvable by standard dynamic programming techniques, policy gradient algorithms face nonconvex optimization problems and are widely understood to converge only to a stationary point. This work identifies structural properties, shared by several classic control problems, that ensure the policy gradient objective function has no suboptimal stationary points despite being nonconvex. When these conditions are strengthened, this objective satisfies a Polyak-lojasiewicz (gradient dominance) condition that yields convergence rates. We also provide bounds on the optimality gap of any stationary point when some of these conditions are relaxed.

Due to their ability to exploit the black-box nature of the problem and the attractive computational simplicity, surrogates have been studied by researchers in multiple scientific and engineering disciplines. Successful use of surrogates shall result in significant savings in terms of computational time and resources. However, with a wide variety of approaches available in the literature, the correct choice of surrogate is a difficult task. An important aspect of this choice is based on the type of problem at hand. This paper reviews recent advances in the area of surrogate models for problems in modeling, feasibility analysis, and optimization. Two of the frequently used surrogates, radial basis functions, and Kriging are tested on a variety of test problems. Finally, guidelines for the choice of appropriate surrogate model are discussed.},

  abstract = {Integration of real-time optimization and control with higher level decision-making (scheduling and planning) is an essential goal for profitable operation in a highly competitive environment. While integrated large-scale optimization models have been formulated for this task, their size and complexity remains a challenge to many available optimization solvers. On the other hand, recent development of powerful, large-scale solvers leads to a reconsideration of these formulations, in particular, through development of efficient large-scale barrier methods for nonlinear programming (NLP). As a result, it is now realistic to solve NLPs on the order of a million variables, for instance, with the IPOPT algorithm. Moreover, the recent NLP sensitivity extension to IPOPT quickly computes approximate solutions of perturbed NLPs. This allows on-line computations to be drastically reduced, even when large nonlinear optimization models are considered. These developments are demonstrated on dynamic real-time optimization strategies that can be used to merge and replace the tasks of (steady-state) real-time optimization and (linear) model predictive control. We consider a recent case study of a low density polyethylene (LDPE) process to illustrate these concepts.},

This paper explores and reviews control techniques based on repeated solution of nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. Here several advantages present themselves. These include minimization of readily quantifiable objectives, coordinated and accurate handling of process nonlinearities and interactions, and systematic ways of dealing with process constraints. We motivate this NLP-based approach with small nonlinear examples and present a basic algorithm for optimization-based process control. As can be seen this approach is a straightforward extension of popular model-predictive controllers (MPCs) that are used for linear systems. The statement of the basic algorithm raises a number of questions regarding stability and robustness of the method, efficiency of the control calculations, incorporation of feedback into the controller and reliable ways of handling process constraints. Each of these will be treated through analysis and/or modification of the basic algorithm. To highlight and support this discussion, several examples are presented and key results are examined and further developed. 74 refs., 11 figs.},

Results of numerical experiments on up to 256 Cray T3E-900 processors demonstrate very good scalability of the new method. Moreover, LNKS is an order of magnitude faster than quasi-Newton reduced SQP, and we are able to solve previously intractable problems of up to 800,000 state and 5,000 decision variables at about 5 times the cost of a single forward flow solution.},

  abstract = {Large-scale optimization of systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is a frontier problem in scientific computation. Reduced quasi-Newton sequential quadratic programming (SQP) methods are state-of-the-art approaches for such problems. These methods take full advantage of existing PDE solver technology and parallelize well. However, their algorithmic scalability is questionable; for certain problem classes they can be very slow to converge. In this two-part article we propose a new method for steady-state PDE-constrained optimization, based on the idea of using a full space Newton solver combined with an approximate reduced space quasiNewton SQP preconditioner. The basic components of the method are Newton solution of the first-order optimality conditions that characterize stationarity of the Lagrangian function; Krylov solution of the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) linear systems arising at each Newton iteration using a symmetric quasi-minimum residual method; preconditioning of the KKT system using an approximate state/decision variable decomposition that replaces the forward PDE Jacobians by their own preconditioners, and the decision space Schur complement (the reduced Hessian) by a BFGS approximation initialized by a two-step stationary method. Accordingly, we term the new method Lagrange--Newton--Krylov--Schur (LNKS). It is fully parallelizable, exploits the structure of available parallel algorithms for the PDE forward problem, and is locally quadratically convergent. In part I of this two-part article, we investigate the effectiveness of the KKT linear system solver. We test our method on two optimal control problems in which the state constraints are described by the steady-state Stokes equations. The objective is to minimize dissipation or the deviation from a given velocity field; the control variables are the boundary velocities. Numerical experiments on up to 256 Cray T3E processors and on an SGI Origin 2000 include scalability and performance assessment of the LNKS algorithm and comparisons with reduced SQP for up to 1, 000, 000 state and 50,000 decision variables. In part II of the article, we address globalization and inexactness issues, and apply LNKS to the optimal control of the steady incompressible Navier--Stokes equations.},

The design results in a dynamic virtual power plant (DVPP), whose aggregated output fulfills the system operator's (SO's) requirements in all timescales, while accounting for the capacity and bandwidth limitation of participating devices. This is illustrated in a 5-machine representation of the Nordic synchronous grid. In the Nordic grid, stability issues and bandwidth limitations associated with nonminimum phase zeros of hydropower is a well-known problem. By simulating the disconnection of a 1400 MW importing dc link, it is shown that the proposed DVPP design allows for coordinating fast FFR from wind, with slow FCR from hydro, while respecting dynamic limitations of all participating devices. The SO's requirements are fulfilled in a realistic low-inertia scenario without the need to install battery storage or to waste wind energy by curtailing the wind turbines.},

  abstract = {The production and use of energy and the capture and use of water are vital to the economy and the health and welfare of all nations, and the wise stewardship of these resources is essential to the protection of the environment. After the 6th World Water Forum held in Marseille (France, 2012), {\'E}lectricit{\'e} de France (EDF) and the World Water Council (WWC) have agreed to work on ``the multipurpose water uses of hydropower reservoirs''. This framework bridges between 6th Forum in Marseille and the 7th Forum in Daegu/Gyeongbuk in the Republic of Korea and addresses the following issues: (i) how to minimize contradictions/competition among multipurpose water uses of hydropower reservoirs, and (ii) how to set an appropriate governance to allow coordinated/integrated water uses management (in terms of strategy, planning, decision-making and operation). This process was conducted under a participative multi-stakeholder approach with governments, banks, NGOs, international organizations, hydropower utilities, and other sectors. Multipurpose hydropower reservoirs are designed and/or operated to provide services beyond electricity generation, such as water supply, flood and drought management, irrigation, navigation, fisheries, environmental services and recreational activities, etc. While these objectives (renewable and power services, water quantity management, ecosystem services, economic growth and local livelihoods) can conflict at times, they are also often complementary. Although there are no universal solutions, there are principles that can be shared and adapted to local contexts. Indeed the development and/or operation of such multipurpose hydropower reservoirs to reach sustainable water management should rely on the following principles: shared vision, shared resource, shared responsibilities, shared rights and risks, shared costs and benefits. These principles and acknowledgement of joint sharing among all the stakeholders are essential to successful development and management of multipurpose hydropower reservoirs, and should frame all phases from early stage to operation. The SHARE concept also gives guidance. Based on 12 worldwide case studies of multipurpose hydropower reservoirs, the SHARE concept was developed and proposed as a solution to address this issue. A special focus will be presented on the Durance--Verdon Rivers in France.

Il n'y a pas de solutions universelles, mais il existe cependant des principes qui peuvent {\^e}tre partag{\'e}s et adapt{\'e}s aux contextes locaux. En effet, le d{\'e}veloppement et/ou l'exploitation de ces r{\'e}servoirs hydro{\'e}lectriques {\`a} buts multiples devrait s'appuyer, pour atteindre une gestion durable de l'eau, sur une vision partag{\'e}e dans tous les domaines : ressource, responsabilit{\'e}s, droits et risques, co{\^u}ts et b{\'e}n{\'e}fices. Ces principes de reconnaissance du partage commun entre toutes les parties prenantes sont essentiels pour le d{\'e}veloppement et la gestion r{\'e}ussis de ces r{\'e}servoirs hydro{\'e}lectriques {\`a} usages multiples, et devraient encadrer toutes les phases de tels r{\'e}servoirs, et surtout d{\`e}s les phases amont ({\'e}tudes).

  abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

  abstract = {Capacity expansion models for the electric power system often employ zonal (rather than nodal) resolution, necessitating estimates of aggregate power transfer limits across the interfaces between model zones. Interface limits between planning areas are sometimes published, but they are not generalizable to arbitrary zone shapes. There is thus a need for a reproducible method for estimating interface transfer limits (ITLs) between user-defined zones directly from nodal transmission system data. Here, we present a simple method for estimating ITLs using a DC power flow approximation via the power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix. Linear optimization is performed to identify the distribution of power flows that maximizes the total flow on interface-crossing lines, subject to individual line ratings, limits on bus injection/withdrawal, and the relationships among flows, injections, and withdrawals imposed by the PTDF matrix. We demonstrate the application of the method on a 134-zone {\textasciitilde}65000-bus system, and we explore the influence of flow direction, contingency level, and zone size on the estimated ITLs. There is significant heterogeneity in the ratio of the ITL to the sum of interface-crossing line ratings, which highlights the importance of accounting for the physical constraints on power flows imposed by Kirchhoff's laws when estimating zonal ITLs.},

  abstract = {Iterative methods for linear systems of algebraic equations arising from the finite element discretization of nonsymmetric and indefinite elliptic problems are considered. Methods previously known to work well for positive definite, symmetric problems are extended to certain nonsymmetric problems, which can also have some eigenvalues in the left half plane. This paper presents an additive Schwarz method applied to linear, second order, symmetric or nonsymmetric, indefinite elliptic boundary value problems in two and three dimensions. An alternative linear system, which has the same solution as the original problem, is derived and this system is then solved by using GMRES, an iterative method of conjugate gradient type. In each iteration step, a coarse mesh finite element problem and a number of local problems are solved on small, overlapping subregions into which the original region is subdivided. The rate of convergence is shown to be independent of the number of degrees of freedom and the number of local problems if the coarse mesh is fine enough. The performance of the method in two dimensions is illustrated by results of several numerical experiments. Two other iterative methods for solving the same class of elliptic problems in two dimensions is also considered. Using an observation of Dryja and Widlund, it is shown that the rate of convergence of certain iterative substructuring methods deteriorates only quite slowly when the local problems increase in size. A similar result is established for Yserentant's hierarchical basis method.

  year = 2012,
  journal = {Federal Energy Regulatory Commission},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and propose areas where the ACOPF could be improved. The ACOPF is at the heart of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets, and is solved in some form every year for system planning, every day for day-ahead markets, every hour, and even every 5 minutes. It was first formulated in 1962, and formulations have changed little over the years. With advances in computing power and solution algorithms, we can model more of the constraints and remove unnecessary limits and approximations that were previously required to find a solution in reasonable time. One example is nonlinear voltage magnitude constraints that are modeled as linear thermal proxy constraints. In this paper, we refer to the full ACOPF as an ACOPF that simultaneously optimizes real and reactive power. Today, 50 years after the problem was formulated, we still do not have a fast, robust solution technique for the full ACOPF. Finding a good solution technique for the full ACOPF could potentially save tens of billions of dollars annually. Based on our literature review, we find that the ACOPF research community lacks a common understanding of the problem, its formulation, and objective functions. However, we do not claim that this literature review is a complete review---our intent was simply to capture the major formulations of the ACOPF. Instead, in this paper, we seek to clearly present the ACOPF problem through clear formulations of the problem and its parameters. This paper defines and discusses the polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage formulations of the ACOPF. Additionally, it discusses the different types of constraints and objective functions. This paper lays the groundwork for further research on the convex approximation of the ACOPF solution space, a survey of solution techniques, and computational performance of different formulations.},

Firstly, the control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Then a noisy network based deep reinforcement learning approach is proposed to learn an optimized control policy for storage charging/discharging strategy. To address the uncertainty of electricity price, a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is adopted to predict the price for the next day. Finally, the proposed approach is tested on the historical U.K. wholesale electricity market prices.

We find that the MPC framework can drastically reduce long-term degradation while properly responding to FR and energy market signals (compared to MPC formulations that use low-fidelity models). Our results also provide evidence that sophisticated battery models can be embedded within closed-loop MPC simulations by using modern nonlinear programming solvers (we provide an efficient and easy-to-use implementation in Julia). We use insights obtained with our simulations to design a low-complexity MPC formulation that matches the behavior obtained with high-fidelity models. This is done by designing a suitable terminal penalty term that implicitly captures long-term degradation. The results suggest that complex degradation behavior can be accounted for in low-complexity MPC formulations by properly designing the cost function. We believe that our proof-of-concept results can be of industrial relevance, as battery vendors are seeking to participate in fast-changing electricity markets while maintaining asset integrity.},

  abstract = {To sustain Africa's growth, and accelerate the eradication of extreme poverty, investment in infrastructure is fundamental. In 2010, the Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic found that to enable Africa to fill its infrastructure gap, some US\$ 93 billion per year for the next decade will need to be invested. The Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA), endorsed in 2012 by the continent's Heads of State and Government, lays out an ambitious long-term plan for closing Africa's infrastructure including trough step increases in hydroelectric power generation and water storage capacity. Much of this investment will support the construction of long-lived infrastructure (e.g. dams, power stations, irrigation canals), which may be vulnerable to changes in climatic patterns, the direction and magnitude of which remain significantly uncertain. Enhancing the Climate Resilience of Africa 's Infrastructure evaluates -using for the first time a single consistent methodology and the state-of-the-arte climate scenarios-, the impacts of climate change on hydro-power and irrigation expansion plans in Africa's main rivers basins (Niger, Senegal, Volta, Congo, Nile, Zambezi, Orange); and outlines an approach to reduce climate risks through suitable adjustments to the planning and design process. The book finds that failure to integrate climate change in the planning and design of power and water infrastructure could entail, in scenarios of drying climate conditions, losses of hydropower revenues between 5\% and 60\% (depending on the basin); and increases in consumer expenditure for energy up to 3 times the corresponding baseline values. In in wet climate scenarios, business-as-usual infrastructure development could lead to foregone revenues in the range of 15\% to 130\% of the baseline, to the extent that the larger volume of precipitation is not used to expand the production of hydropower. Despite the large uncertainty on whether drier or wetter conditions will prevail in the future in Africa, the book finds that by modifying existing investment plans to explicitly handle the risk of large climate swings, can cut in half or more the cost that would accrue by building infrastructure on the basis of the climate of the past.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel machine-learning approach for predicting AC-OPF solutions that features a fast and scalable training. It is motivated by the significant training time needed by existing machine-learning approaches for predicting AC-OPF. The proposed approach is a 2-stage methodology that exploits a spatial decomposition of the power network that is viewed as a set of regions. The first stage learns to predict the flows and voltages on the buses and lines coupling the regions, and the second stage trains, in parallel, the machine-learning models for each region. The predictions can then seed a power flow to eliminate the physical constraint violations, resulting in minor violations only for the operational bound constraints. Experimental results on the French transmission system (up to 6,700 buses) and large test cases from the pglib library (up to 9,000 buses) demonstrate the potential of the approach. Within a short training time, the approach predicts AC-OPF solutions with very high fidelity, producing significant improvements over the state-of-the-art. The proposed approach thus opens the possibility of training machine-learning models quickly to respond to changes in operating conditions.},

In this work, we propose PROjected Feasibility (PROF), a method to enforce convex operational constraints within neural policies. Specifically, we incorporate a differentiable projection layer within a neural network-based policy to enforce that all learned actions are feasible. We then update the policy end-to-end by propagating gradients through this differentiable projection layer, making the policy cognizant of the operational constraints. We demonstrate our method on two applications: energy-efficient building operation and inverter control. In the building operation setting, we show that PROF maintains thermal comfort requirements while improving energy efficiency by 4\% over state-of-the-art methods. In the inverter control setting, PROF perfectly satisfies voltage constraints on the IEEE 37-bus feeder system, as it learns to curtail as little renewable energy as possible within its safety set.},

By using a parametrization based on the Hessian of the negative log-posterior, the adaptive sparse quadrature can effectively allocate the quadrature points according to the posterior distribution. A dimension-independent convergence rate of the proposed method is established under certain assumptions on the Gaussian prior and the integrands. Dimension-independent and faster convergence than O(N-1/2) is demonstrated for a linear as well as a nonlinear inverse problem whose posterior distribution can be effectively approximated by a Gaussian distribution at the MAP point.},

The unknown parameters in the covariance models can be estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, but direct construction of the covariance matrix and classical strategies of computing with it require physical model runs, storage complexity, and computational complexity. To address such challenges, we propose to approximate the discretized covariance function using hierarchical matrices. By utilizing randomized range sketching for individual off-diagonal blocks, the construction process of the hierarchical covariance approximation requires physical model applications and the maximum likelihood computations require effort per iteration. We propose a new approach to compute exactly the trace of products of hierarchical matrices which results in the expected Fisher information matrix being computable in as well. The construction is totally matrix-free and the derivatives of the covariance matrix can then be approximated in the same hierarchical structure by differentiating the whole process. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method for parameter estimations and uncertainty quantification.},

Emerging research shows that GPU-based linear system solvers are beginning to achieve notable speedup over CPU-based alternatives in some applications. Due to the architecture of GPU memory access, numerical pivoting represents the new bottleneck which prevents GPU-based solvers from running even faster. Accordingly, this paper proposes a matrix perturbation-based method to induce static pivoting. Using this approach, a series of perturbed, well-conditioned, pivot-free linear systems are solved in parallel on GPUs. Matrix expansion routines are then used to linearly combine the results, and the true solution is recovered to an arbitrarily high degree of theoretical accuracy. We showcase the validity of our approach on distributed-slack AC power flow solve iterations associated with the PGLib 300-bus test case.},

  abstract = {Dynamic models of biochemical networks are often formulated as sets of non-linear ordinary differential equations, whose states are the concentrations or abundances of the network components. They typically have a large number of kinetic parameters, which must be determined by calibrating the model with experimental data. In recent years it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models are universally sloppy, meaning that the values of some parameters can be perturbed by several orders of magnitude without causing significant changes in the model output. This observation has prompted calls for focusing on model predictions rather than on parameters. In this work we examine the concept of sloppiness, investigating its links with the long-established notions of structural and practical identifiability. By analysing a set of case studies we show that sloppiness is not equivalent to lack of identifiability, and that sloppy models can be identifiable. Thus, using sloppiness to draw conclusions about the possibility of estimating parameter values can be misleading. Instead, structural and practical identifiability analyses are better tools for assessing the confidence in parameter estimates. Furthermore, we show that, when designing new experiments to decrease parametric uncertainty, designs that optimize practical identifiability criteria are more informative than those that minimize sloppiness.},

It is also used in many machine learning applications, such as \${\textbackslash}ell\_1\$-regularized SVMs, basis pursuit, nonnegative matrix factorization, etc. Interior Point Methods (IPMs) are one of the most popular methods to solve LPs both in theory and in practice. Their underlying complexity is dominated by the cost of solving a system of linear equations at each iteration. In this paper, we consider both feasible and infeasible IPMs for the special case where the number of variables is much larger than the number of constraints. Using tools from Randomized Linear Algebra, we present a preconditioning technique that, when combined with the iterative solvers such as Conjugate Gradient or Chebyshev Iteration, provably guarantees that IPM algorithms (suitably modified to account for the error incurred by the approximate solver), converge to a feasible, approximately optimal solution, without increasing their iteration complexity.

We find that a low-carbon transition exerts the strongest development pressure, causing deployment exceeding 80\% of exploitable potential in more than 72\% of eco-sensitive basins by 2050, most of which have limited deployment today. Rapid economic growth induces such extensive deployment in only 44\% of eco-sensitive basins. Enhanced integration of VRE reduces deployment, alleviating the impacts of rapid economic growth but not the low-carbon transition. Our findings will help to navigate sustainable hydropower development considering both energy-economic and eco-conservation goals.},

  abstract = {Rapid urbanization throughout the globe increases demand for fresh water and the ecosystem services associated with it. This need is conventionally met through the construction of infrastructure. Natural infrastructure solutions have increased to provide freshwater ecosystem services, but little global research has examined the intricate relationships between built and natural infrastructure for providing freshwater ecosystem services to cities across the globe. Using network analysis, here we examine the interrelationships between built and natural infrastructure in 2,113 watersheds for 317 cities worldwide, focusing on four key freshwater ecosystem services: freshwater provision, sediment regulation, flood mitigation and hydropower production. Our results indicate that protected wetlands contribute to sustaining freshwater provision to cities. Forest cover in protected areas can improve the capacity of large dams in reducing sediment loads and producing hydropower, but cities mainly depend on reduced impervious surfaces and more green spaces within urban areas for flood mitigation. Improved understandings of the role of natural infrastructure in urban water networks must underpin strategic decision-making to sustainably provide freshwater ecosystem services to global cities.},

These emerging methods range from new power flow approximations, which go beyond the traditional DC power flow by capturing reactive power, to convex relaxations, which provide solution quality and runtime performance guarantees. Unfortunately, the sophistication of these emerging methods often presents a significant barrier to evaluating them on a wide variety of power system optimization applications. To address this issue, this work proposes PowerModels, an open-source platform for comparing power flow formulations. From its inception, PowerModels was designed to streamline the process of evaluating different power flow formulations on shared optimization problem specifications. This work provides a brief introduction to the design of PowerModels, validates its implementation, and demonstrates its effectiveness with a proof-of-concept study analyzing five different formulations of the Optimal Power Flow problem.},

The presented method reduces the MPC problem by eliminating the state variables and applies a condensed-space interior-point method to remove the inequality constraints in the KKT system. The final condensed matrix is positive definite and can be efficiently factorized in parallel on GPU/SIMD architectures. In addition, the size of the condensed matrix depends only on the number of controls in the problem, rendering the method particularly effective when the problem has many states but few inputs and moderate horizon length. Our numerical results for PDE-constrained problems show that the approach is an order of magnitude faster than a standard CPU implementation. We also provide an open-source Julia framework that facilitates modeling (DynamicNLPModels.jl) and solution (MadNLP.jl) of MPC problems on GPUs.},

In this work, we present PlasmoData.jl, an open-source, Julia framework that uses concepts of graph theory to facilitate the modeling and analysis of complex datasets. The core of our framework is a general data modeling abstraction, which we call a DataGraph. We show how the abstraction and software implementation can be used to represent diverse data objects as graphs and to enable the use of tools from topology, graph theory, and machine learning (e.g., graph neural networks) to conduct a variety of tasks. We illustrate the versatility of the framework by using real datasets: i) an image classification problem using topological data analysis to extract features from the graph model to train machine learning models; ii) a disease outbreak problem where we model multivariate time series as graphs to detect abnormal events; and iii) a technology pathway analysis problem where we highlight how we can use graphs to navigate connectivity. Our discussion also highlights how PlasmoData.jl leverages native Julia capabilities to enable compact syntax, scalable computations, and interfaces with diverse packages.},

Such information is presumed absent in pattern search methods; however, we show how we can replace this with a stopping criterion based on the pattern size in a way that preserves the convergence properties of the original algorithm. In this way we proceed by successive, inexact, bound constrained minimization without knowing exactly how inexact the minimization is. As far as we know, this is the first provably convergent direct search method for general nonlinear programming.},

The country is heavily reliant on water resources, with 77.7\% of water consumed for agriculture (irrigation and livestock), 9.7\% for the industry, and 11.4\% for human supply. Hydropower plants generate about 64\% of all electricity consumed. The aim of this study was to improve the current state of knowledge regarding hydrological drought patterns in Brazil, hydrometeorological factors, and their effects on the country's hydroelectric power plants. The results show that since the drought occurred in 2014/2015 over the Southeast region of Brazil, several basins were sharply impacted and remain in a critical condition until now. Following that event, other regions have experienced droughts, with critical rainfall deficit and high temperatures, causing a pronounced impact on water availability in many of the studied basins. Most of the hydropower plants end the 2020--2021 rainy season by operating at a fraction of their total capacity, and thus the country's hydropower generation was under critical regime.},

  abstract = {At the heart of deep learning we aim to use neural networks as function approximators -  training them to produce outputs from inputs in emulation of a ground truth function or data creation process. In many cases we only have access to input-output pairs from the ground truth, however it is becoming more common to have access to derivatives of the target output with respect to the input -- for example when the ground truth function is itself a neural network such as in network compression or distillation.  Generally these target derivatives are not computed, or are ignored. This paper introduces Sobolev Training for neural networks, which is a method for incorporating these target derivatives in addition the to target values while training. By optimising neural networks to not only approximate the function's outputs but also the function's derivatives we encode additional information about the target function within the parameters of the neural network. Thereby we can improve the quality of our predictors, as well as the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of our learned function approximation. We provide theoretical justifications for such an approach as well as examples of empirical evidence on three distinct domains: regression on classical optimisation datasets, distilling policies of an agent playing Atari, and on large-scale applications of synthetic gradients.  In all three domains the use of Sobolev Training, employing target derivatives in addition to target values, results in models with higher accuracy and stronger generalisation.},

As most chemical mechanisms are more complex than can be supported by available laboratory measurements, model reduction is a required first step. The quasisteady-state assumption and the reaction equilibrium assumption are presented as the two main model reduction methods. Reliable quantification of the approximate confidence intervals of the estimated parameters is a second key step. A brief overview of current numerical software for this purpose is provided. Parameter estimation with a starting mechanism and typically available simulated laboratory measurements is then applied to three illustrative example systems: (i) an electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction, (ii) butene isomerization by a metathesis mechanism, and (iii) enzymatic kinetics taking place in bacterial microcompartments. The reliability of the model reduction techniques and the current computational software is assessed based on the outcomes of these three example chemistries. In all three examples, the quasisteady-state assumption was required to remove some large rate constants governing low concentration, highly reactive species that could not be measured. After the model reduction, the parameter confidence intervals were then used to determine what extra measurements were required to identify the model, or the model was reparameterized to obtain an identifiable reduced set of parameters for the given measurements.},

  abstract = {Robust security-constrained optimal power flow (rSCOPF) aims to find the worst-case contingencies of alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) in power systems. With the rise of GPU architectures on the upcoming supercomputer architectures, optimization algorithms that rely on sparse linear algebra and indefinite linear systems are becoming increasingly hard to solve efficiently (e.g. interior-point method). To address this we revisit a maximin optimization formulation of the rSCOPF and the single-level mixed-integer semidefinite programming (MISDP) reformulation, which is obtained by taking the Lagrangian relaxation of the inner minimization ACOPF problem. In this paper, we focus on the development of a proximal projection bundle method (PPBM) for solving continuous relaxation node subproblems of the MISDP problem, based primarily on the well-known alternating direction method of multipliers. Cutting planes reminiscent of bundle method ideas are also applied in coordination with updates of the proximal parameter. The cutting-plane method can generate a large number of linear inequalities, leading to a large scale but decomposable quadratic programming (QP) subproblem that is amenable to GPUs. We present the numerical results on the IEEE 30, 57, 118, and 300-bus systems by using our PBMM method.

The problem is defined as one of decomposing process networks into constituent subnetworks with strong intra-subnetwork and weak inter-subnetwork interactions. These interactions are quantified based on connectivity and response sensitivity information. This perspective is inspired by the community detection problem in networks. Several approaches are discussed based on hierarchical clustering and modularity optimization. The concepts and potential of these methods for developing control architectures for complex plants are illustrated through a case study. Future research directions are also discussed.},

We propose a multistage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

We analyze how these three factors collectively may potentially change the future operation and economics of federal dams and hydropower plants located in the Colorado River Basin (CRB). Federal CRB energy and capacity resources, including 4,200 MW of hydropower capacity, are marketed by Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) and sold through long-term Firm Electric Service (FES) contracts to entities located in 15 western and central States that serve millions of electricity consumers. The parameters of FES contracts allow a wide range of scheduling flexibility for FES customers. The FES customers will adjust the timing of energy delivery according to the changing water, power market, and VRE contribution level to the power grid. We simulate and project water and hydropower operations with two models: 1) reservoir operation and 2) power system operation (production cost) with various temporal granularity. We consider two sets of grid scenarios (one representing today's infrastructure, and one representing higher VRE contributions in 2036) and two sets of water scenarios (drought and normal hydrology). We modeled scenarios to understand the power market-energy price levels and patterns, FES customer scheduling, hydropower economics, WAPA finances and hydropower operation for various hydrologic conditions, and VRE contribution level to the power grid. The detailed modeling framework includes: (1) creating ensembles of CRB hydrologic and hydropower futures, (2) selecting representative futures, (3) simulation of FES customer contracts, (4) simulating western U.S. power grid economic scheduling and dispatch under two VRE contribution levels, utilizing information from modeling steps (1)-(4), (5) assessment of reservoir water and hydropower operation, and (6) comparing scenario operations and economics. Our study team comprising WAPA, and an interdisciplinary team of national labs will gain insight into how WAPA can prepare for and adapt its practices in response to an evolving U.S. power grid.},

Despite using a simplified model, the robot is capable of robust locomotion at a variety of speeds. Experimental results demonstrate control of gaits including stand, trot, flying-trot, pronk, bound, pace, a 3-legged gait, and a full 3D gallop. The robot achieved forward speeds of up to 3 m/s, lateral speeds up to 1 m/s, and angular speeds up to 180 deg/sec. Our approach is general enough to perform all these behaviors with the same set of gains and weights.},

  abstract = {Solving tridiagonal linear-equation systems is a fundamental computing kernel in a wide range of scientific and engineering applications, and its computation can be modeled with parallel algorithms. These parallel solvers are typically designed to compute problems whose data fit in a common shared-memory space where all the cores taking part in the computation have access. However, when the problem size is large, data cannot be entirely stored in the common shared-memory space, and a high number of high-latency communications are performed. One alternative is to partition the problem among different memory spaces. At this point, conventional parallel algorithms do not facilitate the partition of computation in independent tiles, since each reduction depends on equations that may be in different tiles. This article proposes an algorithm based on a tree reduction, called               the Tree Partitioning Reduction               (TPR) method, which partitions the problem into independent slices that can be partially computed in parallel within different common shared-memory spaces. The TPR method can be implemented for any parallel and distributed programming paradigm. Furthermore, in this work, TPR is efficiently implemented for CUDA GPUs to solve large size problems, providing highly competitive performance results with respect to existing packages, being, on average, 22.03{\texttimes} faster than CUSPARSE.},

These computational experiments differ from the original results in that we have deleted problems that were considered to be too easy. Moreover, in the current version of the computational experiments, each problem is tested with four variations.

Unfortunately, naive deep learning approaches typically cannot enforce the hard constraints of such problems, leading to infeasible solutions. In this work, we present Deep Constraint Completion and Correction (DC3), an algorithm to address this challenge. Specifically, this method enforces feasibility via a differentiable procedure, which implicitly completes partial solutions to satisfy equality constraints and unrolls gradient-based corrections to satisfy inequality constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DC3 in both synthetic optimization tasks and the real-world setting of AC optimal power flow, where hard constraints encode the physics of the electrical grid. In both cases, DC3 achieves near-optimal objective values while preserving feasibility.},

We review the history and the countless applications of this model throughout science and engineering. We justify the importance of the widespread coupled oscillator model as a locally canonical model and describe some selected applications relevant to control scientists, including vehicle coordination, electric power networks, and clock synchronization. We introduce the reader to several synchronization notions and performance estimates. We propose analysis approaches to phase and frequency synchronization, phase balancing, pattern formation, and partial synchronization. We present the sharpest known results about synchronization in networks of homogeneous and heterogeneous oscillators, with complete or sparse interconnection topologies, and in finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional settings.

In this study, we address these challenges and present a framework for efficient large scale flowsheet optimization. This framework couples advanced process optimization formulations with state-of-the-art algorithms, and includes several notable features such as (1) an optimization-friendly formulation of cubic equation of state thermodynamic models; (2) a new model for distillation column optimization based on rigorous mass, equilibrium, summation and heat (MESH) equations with a variable number of trays that avoids integer variables; (3) improvements on the Duran--Grossmann formulation for simultaneous heat integration and flowsheet optimization; and (4) a systematic initialization procedure based on model refinements and a tailored multi-start algorithm to improve feasibility and identify high quality local solutions. Capabilities of the framework are demonstrated on a cryogenic air separation unit synthesis study, including two thermally coupled distillation columns and accompanying multistream heat exchangers. A superstructure is formulated that includes several common ASU configurations in literature. As part of the optimization problem the solver selects the best topology in addition to operating conditions (temperatures, flowrates, etc.) for coal oxycombustion applications. The optimization problem includes up to 16,000 variables and 500 degrees of freedom, and predicts specific energy requirement of 0.18 to 0.25kWh/kg of O2 depending on design assumptions. These results are compared to literature and plans to extend the framework to an entire coal oxycombustion power plant optimization study are discussed.},

Such coordination is achieved through hierarchical market transactions. This work presents an optimization framework to evaluate revenue opportunities provided by these multi-scale market hierarchies and to determine optimal participation strategies for individual participants. The proposed framework models day-ahead and real-time transactions of energy, ancillary services, and virtual bidding products provided by independent system operators (ISOs). We apply the framework to a combined heat and power system and a utility-scale battery to determine revenue potential from different market layers and products. Analysis using real price signals for 2015 from the California ISO reveals that 60--90\% of the total revenue potential (obtained by participating in all markets) is provided by real-time markets alone (which operate at fast timescales). Our studies also indicate that providing ancillary services (in addition to day-ahead and real-time energy products) increases revenue potential by 40--100\%, depending on the physical flexibility of the technology. The proposed framework can be used to identify which market layers and products offer the greatest economic potential for different energy technologies. Our results also highlight that existing techno-economic studies that focus exclusively on day-ahead energy markets (operating at slower timescales) can dramatically undervalue dynamic flexibility.},

Efficient use of sparsity is a key to solving large problems in many fields. This second edition is a complete rewrite of the first edition published 30 years ago. Much has changed since that time. Problems have grown greatly in size and complexity; nearly all examples in the first edition were of order less than 5,000 in the first edition, and are often more than a million in the second edition. Computer architectures are now much more complex, requiring new ways of adapting algorithms to parallel environments with memory hierarchies. Because the area is such an important one to all of computational science and engineering, a huge amount of research has been done in the last 30 years, some of it by the authors themselves. This new research is integrated into the text with a clear explanation of the underlying mathematics and algorithms. New research that is described includes new techniques for scaling and error control, new orderings, new combinatorial techniques for partitioning both symmetric and unsymmetric problems, and a detailed description of the multifrontal approach to solving systems that was pioneered by the research of the authors and colleagues. This includes a discussion of techniques for exploiting parallel architectures and new work for indefinite and unsymmetric systems.},

A variety of algorithms has been devised for solving problems expressed in terms of complementarity conditions. It is thus attractive to consider extending algebraic modeling languages, which are widely used for sending ordinary equations and inequality constraints to solvers, so that they can express complementarity problems directly. We describe an extension to the AMPL modeling language that can express the most common complementarity conditions in a concise and flexible way, through the introduction of a single new "complements" operator. We present details of an efficient implementation that incorporates an augmented presolve phase to simplify complementarity problems, and that converts complementarity conditions to a canonical form convenient for solvers.},

  abstract = {LNG carriers play a crucial role in the shipping industry meeting the global demand for natural gas (NG). However, the energy losses resulting from the propulsion system and the excess boil-off gas (BOG) cannot be overlooked. The present article investigates the H2 production on board LNG carriers employing both the engine's waste heat (WH) and the excess BOG. Conventional (ORC) and dual-pressure (2P-ORC) organic Rankine cycles coupled separately with a solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC) have been simulated and compared. The hydrogen (H2) produced is then compressed at 150~bar for subsequent use as required. According to the results, the 2P-ORC generates 14.79~\% more power compared to ORC, allowing for an increased energy supply to the SOEC; hence, producing more H2 (34.47~kg/h compared to 31.14~kg/h). Including the 2P-ORC in the H2 production plant results in a cheaper H2 cost by 0.04 \$/kgH2 compared to ORC, a 1.13~\%LHV higher system efficiency when leveraging all the available waste heat. The plant including 2P-ORC exploits more than 86~\% of the of the available waste compared to 70~\% when using ORC. Excluding the compression system decreases the capital cost by almost the half regardless of the WH recovery system used, yet it plays in favour of the plant with ORC making the cost of H2 cheaper by 0.29 \$/kgH2 in this case. Onboard H2 production is a versatile process independent from the propulsion system ensuring the ship's safety and availability throughout a sea journey.},

Decomposition schemes can help achieve scalability; classical decomposition approaches such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and distributed Newtons schemes, however, often either suffer from slow convergence or might require high degrees of communication. In this work, we present new primal decomposition schemes for solving large-scale, strongly convex QPs. These approaches have global convergence guarantees and require limited communication. We benchmark their performance against the off-the-shelf interior-point method Ipopt and against ADMM on infrastructure networks that contain up to 300,000 decision variables and constraints. Overall, we find that the proposed approaches solve problems as fast as Ipopt but with reduced communication. Moreover, we find that the proposed schemes achieve higher accuracy than ADMM approaches.},

  abstract = {From a sustainability perspective, a synergy between hydrogen, electricity and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is particularly attractive. A combination of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cells and PEM electrolyzers provides a back-up system for RES avoiding the intermittency: electrolyzers convert the excess of energy from RES into hydrogen and PEM fuel cells use this hydrogen to convert it back into electricity when it is needed. Models are an essential tool in electrolyzer development because it allows to understand the influence of different parameters on the electrolyzer performance enabling an efficient simulation, design and optimization of electrolyzer systems. Modelling studies have been developed with different degrees of complexity. This review presents a compilation of published models focusing on the main equations used to predict cell voltage, including reversible voltage, activation losses, ohmic losses and mass transport losses. Special sections are devoted to dynamic behaviour, two-phase flow effects and inclusion of thermal effects in model development. Also, a brief description of empirical/semi-empirical models is provided. This review aims to provide the main guidelines for the beginners on PEM electrolyzer modelling and, for this purpose, includes a section with the technology basic principles.},

At each time step, a trajectory is assumed to be known over a finite horizon, and an MPC controller computes the front steering angle in order to follow the trajectory on slippery roads at the highest possible entry speed. We present two approaches with different computational complexities. In the first approach, we formulate the MPC problem by using a nonlinear vehicle model. The second approach is based on successive online linearization of the vehicle model. Discussions on computational complexity and performance of the two schemes are presented. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC formulation is demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests up to 21 m/s on icy roads},

Here we focus on a different aspect, and explore the water-storage and hydropower potential of areas that are expected to become ice-free during the course of this century. For roughly 185,000 sites that are glacierized at present, we predict the potentially emerging reservoir storage volume and hydropower potential. Using a climate-driven glacier-evolution model5 and topographical analysis6, we estimate a theoretical maximal total storage and hydropower potential of 875~{\textpm}~260 cubic kilometres and 1,355~{\textpm}~515 terawatt-hours per year, respectively (95\% confidence intervals). A first-order suitability assessment that takes into account environmental, technical and economic factors identifies roughly 40 per cent of this potential (355~{\textpm}~105 cubic kilometres and 533~{\textpm}~200 terawatt-hours per year) as possibly being suitable for realization. Three quarters of the potential storage volume is expected to become ice-free by 2050, and the storage volume would be enough to retain about half of the annual runoff leaving the investigated sites. Although local impacts would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, the results indicate that deglacierizing basins could make important contributions to national energy supplies in several countries, particularly in High Mountain Asia.},

  abstract = {Lithium iron phosphate batteries with plateau in the open circuit voltage, hysteresis, and path dependence dynamics due to phase transition during intercalation/de-intercalation are challenging to model and even more challenging to control. A core-shell electrochemical modeling approach is able to capture the phase transition behavior at the cost of using a fine-grained spatial grid to transform the governing Partial Differential Algebraic Equations into Ordinary Differential Algebraic Equations, resulting in a computationally expensive system intractable for the design of real-time battery management system algorithms. This letter presents a reduced-order modeling paradigm to transform the high-dimensional model into a low-dimensional yet accurate control oriented electrochemical model. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Galerkin method is used to reduce the state variable vector from 169 to a meager 9 with negligible loss in fidelity. The reduced-order model is validated against both experimental data and the high-dimensional model for discharging-charging load profiles of different C-rates and real driving cycles. Promising results with one-third the computational burden and a voltage RMS error of less than 0.6\% are achieved.},

  abstract = {Direct policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning and continuous control problems are a popular approach for a variety of reasons: 1) they are easy to implement without explicit knowledge of the underlying model, 2) they are an ``end-to-end'' approach, directly optimizing the performance metric of interest, 3) they inherently allow for richly parameterized policies. A notable drawback is that even in the most basic continuous control problem (that of linear quadratic regulators), these methods must solve a non-convex optimization problem, where little is understood about their efficiency from both computational and statistical perspectives. In contrast, system identification and model based planning in optimal control theory have a much more solid theoretical footing, where much is known with regards to their computational and statistical properties. This work bridges this gap showing that (model free) policy gradient methods globally converge to the optimal solution and are efficient (polynomially so in relevant problem dependent quantities) with regards to their sample and computational complexities.},

The main scope of this work is to characterize the heat ingress to the tank as well as the boil-off rate, depending on the filling level and the insulation layer thickness. The tank is assumed to be in a state of inactivity, such that the fluid phases are initially quiescent and are not released to the exterior. The proposed mathematical model consists of a conjugate heat transfer problem coupled with the SST K-{$\omega$} turbulence model for the fluid phases. The free surface separating liquid and vapor in the tank is tracked using the Volume of Fluid method (VOF). The model is solved using the software ANSYS Fluent. It is shown that the filling level of the tank substantially influences the boiling rate and the degree of stratification, as well as the flow structures generated by free convection. The relation among the insulation thickness and total heat leak is established, showing that the obtained increased heat ingress due to lower insulation thickness values leads to a rise in pressurization and boil-off rates.},

Nevertheless, entry into OPF research is a daunting task for the uninitiated---both due to the sheer volume of literature and because OPF's ubiquity within the electric power systems community has led authors to assume a great deal of prior knowledge that readers unfamiliar with electric power systems may not possess. This article provides an introduction to OPF from an operations research perspective; it describes a complete and concise basis of knowledge for beginning OPF research. The discussion is tailored for the operations researcher who has experience with nonlinear optimization but little knowledge of electrical engineering. Topics covered include power systems modeling, the power flow equations, typical OPF formulations, and common OPF extensions.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

Those MILPs are solved to global optimality using an enhancement of nested Benders decomposition, in which regularization, dynamically refined binary approximations of the state variables and Lagrangian cut techniques are combined to generate Lipschitz continuous non-convex approximations of the value functions. Those approximations are then used to decide whether the approximating MILP has to be dynamically refined and in order to compute feasible solutions for the original MINLP.

Standard PET models rely on black-box descriptions of the thermodynamics of active materials, typically obtained by fitting an open-circuit potential which does not allow for a consistent description of phase-separating materials. Multiphase PET (MPET) was recently developed to describe batteries using white- or gray-box descriptions of the thermodynamics with additional parameters that need to be estimated from experimental data. This work analyzes the identifiability of parameters in the MPET model, including the standard kinetics and diffusion parameters, as well as MPET-specific parameters for the free energy of active materials. Based on synthetic discharge data, both linearized and nonlinear identifiability analyses are performed for an MPET model of a commercial Lithium Iron Phosphate/Graphite battery, which identify which model parameters are not identifiable and which are identifiable only with large uncertainty. The identifiable parameters control phase separation, reaction kinetics, and electrolyte transport, but not solid diffusion, consistent with rate limitation by intercalation reactions at low rates and by electrolyte diffusion at high rates. The article also proposes approaches for reducing parameter identifiability issues.},

Benders devised a clever approach for exploiting the structure of mathematical programming problems withcomplicating variables (variables which, when temporarily fixed, render the remaining optimization problem considerably more tractable). For the class of problems specifically considered by Benders, fixing the values of the complicating variables reduces the given problem to an ordinary linear program, parameterized, of course, by the value of the complicating variables vector. The algorithm he proposed for finding the optimal value of this vector employs a cutting-plane approach for building up adequate representations of (i) the extremal value of the linear program as a function of the parameterizing vector and (ii) the set of values of the parameterizing vector for which the linear program is feasible. Linear programming duality theory was employed to derive the natural families ofcuts characterizing these representations, and the parameterized linear program itself is used to generate what are usuallydeepest cuts for building up the representations.},

  abstract = {We propose a parallel solver for linear systems of equations arising from the application of Primal Dual Interior Point methods to Dynamic Optimal Power Flow problems. Our solver is based on the Generalized Minimal Residual method in combination with an additive Schwarz domain decomposition method as preconditioner. This preconditioner exploits the structure of Dynamic Optimal Power Flow problems which, after linearization, is given as block-tridiagonal matrix with large diagonal blocks and only few off-diagonal entries. These entries correspond to intertemporal couplings due to ramping and energy storage constraints and are partially neglected in order to induce parallelism. We test our method on a large-scale optimization problem based on data of the German transmission grid and show that a significant parallel speedup can be obtained.},

  abstract = {This paper is proposed to develop a novel mixed-integer model to solve the short-term hydropower optimal scheduling problem. The model is designed with consideration of the optimization of water time delay. The water time delay is the time required for discharging water from upstream reservoir to its downstream reservoir. It is always in change, which makes a real challenge to handle the corresponding mathematical models. In order to develop the model, we formulate water time delay as a nonlinear function of the outflow from upstream reservoir, which can describe the coupling of hydraulic and electric among cascaded hydropower stations accurately. Meanwhile, the complicated head-sensitive water-to-power conversion and piecewise output limits are also taken into account. To overcome the difficulty of solving the mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problem, the formulation above is converted into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem in terms of integer algebra techniques. The applied commercial software is called CPLEX, which can solve the related MILP problem successfully. Based on a case study with 13 reservoirs and 44 hydropower units, the study shows that the proposed model with water-time-delay can improve the operability and economic benefits of scheduling.},

These fields develop formulations that integrate data into physics-based models while exploiting the fact that many mathematical models of natural and engineered systems exhibit an intrinsically low-dimensional solution manifold. In inverse problems, we seek to infer uncertain components of the inputs from observations of the outputs, while in model reduction we seek low-dimensional models that explicitly capture the salient features of the input--output map through approximation in a low-dimensional subspace. In both cases, the result is a predictive model that reflects data-driven learning yet deeply embeds the underlying physics, and thus can be used for design, control and decision-making, often with quantified uncertainties. We highlight recent developments in scalable and efficient algorithms for inverse problems and model reduction governed by large-scale models in the form of partial differential equations. Several illustrative applications to large-scale complex problems across different domains of science and engineering are provided.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study efficient and robust computational methods for solving the security-constrained alternating current optimal power flow (SC-ACOPF) problem, a two-stage nonlinear optimization problem with disjunctive constraints, that is central to the operation of electric power grids. The first-stage problem in SC-ACOPF determines the operation of the power grid in normal condition, whereas the second-stage problem responds to various contingencies of losing generators, transmission lines, and transformers. The two stages are coupled through disjunctive constraints, which model generators' active and reactive power output changes responding to system-wide active power imbalance and voltage deviations after contingencies. Real-world SC-ACOPF problems may involve power grids with more than 30,000 buses and 22,000 contingencies and need to be solved within 10--45\,minutes to get a base case solution with high feasibility and reasonably good generation cost. We develop a comprehensive algorithmic framework to solve SC-ACOPF that meets the challenge of speed, solution quality, and computation robustness. In particular, we develop a smoothing technique to approximate disjunctive constraints by a smooth structure that can be handled by interior-point solvers; we design a distributed optimization algorithm to efficiently generate first-stage solutions; we propose a screening procedure to prioritize contingencies; and finally, we develop a reliable and parallel computation architecture that integrates all algorithmic components. Extensive tests on industry-scale systems demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms.

Contrary to discrete-time problems, the cost is noncoercive in the policy and not all descent directions lead to bounded iterates. We propose geometry-aware gradient descents for the mean and covariance of the policy using the Fisher geometry and the Bures-Wasserstein geometry, respectively. The policy iterates are shown to satisfy an a priori bound, and converge globally to the optimal policy with a linear rate. We further propose a novel PG method with discrete-time policies. The algorithm leverages the continuous-time analysis, and achieves a robust linear convergence across different action frequencies. A numerical experiment confirms the convergence and robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {The state of the art for optimal water reservoir operations is rapidly evolving, driven by emerging societal challenges. Changing values for balancing environmental resources, multisectoral human system pressures, and more frequent climate extremes are increasing the complexity of operational decision making. Today, reservoir operations benefit from technological advances, including improved monitoring and forecasting systems as well as increasing computational power. Past research in this area has largely focused on improving solution algorithms within the limits of the available computational power, using simplified problem formulations that can misrepresent important systemic complexities and intersectoral interactions. In this study, we review the recent literature focusing on how the operation design problem is formulated, rather than solved, to address existing challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. This paper contributes a comprehensive classification of over 300 studies published over the last years into distinctive categories depending on the adopted problem formulation, which clarifies consolidated methodological approaches and emerging trends. Our analysis also suggests that control policy design methods may benefit from broadening the types of information that is used to condition operational decisions, and from using emulation modeling to identify low-order, computationally efficient surrogate models capturing realistic representations of river basin systems' complexity in order to isolate key decision-relevant processes. These advances in reservoir operations hold significant promise for better addressing the challenges of conflicting human pressures and a changing world, which is particularly important, given the renewed interest in dam construction globally.},

The surrogated models are evaluated against an Aspen Plus simulation for accuracy, convergence behavior, computational cost, and ability to extrapolate. The thermodynamic and process unit models can better handle discontinuous, non-smooth behavior, and convergence issues in the surrogated truth model, but poor conditioning in the final system of equations results in a lower accuracy and convergence rate than the process level surrogate. Beyond model accuracy, availability of diverse data, intended re-usability, and the desired outputs must be considered when selecting a level of abstraction.},

When solving this optimal control problem at each time step and implementing the result in a receding horizon fashion, we provide sufficient conditions under which the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable (ISS).},

  abstract = {This paper gives an approach to implementing a second-order primal-dual interior point method. It uses a Taylor polynomial of second order to approximate a primal-dual trajectory. The computations for the second derivative are combined with the computations for the centering direction. Computations in this approach do not require that primal and dual solutions be feasible. Expressions are given to compute all the higher-order derivatives of the trajectory of interest. The implementation ensures that a suitable potential function is reduced by a constant amount at each iteration.There are several salient features of this approach. An adaptive heuristic for estimating the centering parameter is given. The approach used to compute the step length is also adaptive. A new practical approach to compute the starting point is given. This approach treats primal and dual problems symmetrically.Computational results on a subset of problems available from netlib are given. On mutually tested problems the results show that the proposed method requires approximately 40 percent fewer iterations than the implementation proposed in Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno [Tech. Rep. TR J-89-11, Georgia Inst. of Technology, Atlanta, 1989]. It requires approximately 50 percent fewer iterations than the dual affine scaling method in Adler, Karmarkar, Resende, and Veiga [Math. Programming, 44 (1989), pp. 297--336], and 35 percent fewer iterations than the second-order dual affine scaling method in the same paper. The new approach for estimating the centering parameter and finding the step length and the starting point have contributed to the reduction in the number of iterations. However, the contribution due to the use of second derivative is most significant.On the tested problems, on the average the implementation shown was found to be approximately two times faster than OBl (version 02/90) described in Lustig, Marsten, and Shanno and 2.5 times faster than MINOS 5.3 described in Murtagh and Saunders [Tech.

  abstract = {Enterprise-wide optimization (EWO) is a new emerging area that lies at the interface of chemical engineering and operations research, and has become a major goal in the process industries due to the increasing pressures for remaining competitive in the global marketplace. EWO involves optimizing the operations of supply, manufacturing and distribution activities of a company to reduce costs and inventories. A major focus in EWO is the optimal operation of manufacturing facilities, which often requires the use of nonlinear process models. Major operational items include planning, scheduling, real-time optimization and inventory control. One of the key features of EWO is integration of the information and the decision-making among the various functions that comprise the supply chain of the company. This can be achieved with modern IT tools, which together with the internet, have promoted e-commerce. However, as will be discussed, to fully realize the potential of transactional IT tools, the development of sophisticated deterministic and stochastic linear/nonlinear optimization models and algorithms (analytical IT tools) is needed to explore and analyze alternatives of the supply chain to yield overall optimum economic performance, as well as high levels of customer satisfaction. An additional challenge is the integrated and coordinated decision-making across the various functions in a company (purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, sales), across various geographically distributed organizations (vendors, facilities and markets), and across various levels of decision-making (strategic, tactical and operational). {\copyright} 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2005},

Applications include real-time control and planning with increased awareness, routing with micro-scale traffic information, coordinated platooning using traffic signals information, and eco-mobility on demand with guaranteed parking. This paper introduces a control and planning architecture for CAVs, and surveys the state of the art on each functional block therein; the main focus is on techniques to improve energy efficiency. We provide an overview of existing algorithms and their mutual interactions, we present promising optimization-based approaches to CAVs control and identify future challenges.},

This results in time scale separation that makes the model inherently stiff. In this work, a graph-theoretic framework is developed for time scale decomposition of complex reaction networks to separate the slow and fast time scales, and to identify pseudo-species that evolve only in the slow time scale. The reaction network is represented using a directed bi-partite graph and cycles that correspond to closed walks are used to identify interactions between species participating in fast/equilibrated reactions. Subsequently, an algorithm which connects the cycles to form the pseudo-species is utilized to eliminate the fast rate terms. These pseudo-species are used to formulate reduced, non-stiff kinetic models of the reaction system. Two reaction systems are considered to show the efficacy of this framework in the context of thermochemical and biochemical processing.},

To circumvent the problem of infinite dimensionality in the constraints, an equivalence for the feasibility condition is established which leads to a max-min-max constraint. It is shown that if the inequalities are convex, only the vertices in the polyhedron need to be considered to satisfy this constraint. Based on this feature, an algorithm is proposed which uses only a small subset of the vertices in an iterative multiperiod design formulation.

We are able to produce a global linear convergence guarantee for this approach in the setting of finite time horizon and stochastic state dynamics under weak assumptions. The convergence of a projected policy gradient method is also established in order to handle problems with constraints. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm with two examples. The first example is the optimal liquidation of a holding in an asset. We show results for the case where we assume a model for the underlying dynamics and where we apply the method to the data directly. The empirical evidence suggests that the policy gradient method can learn the global optimal solution for a larger class of stochastic systems containing the LQR framework, and that it is more robust with respect to model misspecification when compared to a model-based approach. The second example is an LQR system in a higher dimensional setting with synthetic data.},

Given these goals, hydro-economic models that show the dynamic variation of water values in time and space will be increasingly used to suggest ways to address water scarcity and reduce water conflicts. Hydro-economic models represent spatially distributed water resource systems, infrastructure, management options and economic values in an integrated manner. In these tools water allocations and management are either driven by the economic value of water or evaluated by that measure to provide policy insights and reveal opportunities for better management. A central concept is that water demands are not fixed requirements but rather functions where quantities of water use at different times have varying total and marginal economic values. This paper reviews techniques to characterize the economic value of water use and include such values in mathematical models. We identify the key steps in model design and diverse problems, formulations, levels of integration, spatial and temporal scales, and solution techniques addressed and used by over 60 hydro-economic modeling efforts dating back 45-years from all over the world. We list current limitations of the approach, suggest directions for future work, and recommend ways to improve policy relevance so promising management strategies and policy insights identified by hydro-economic models can be better employed.},

  abstract = {The need for achieving efficient, equitable and sustainable use of water resources to meet water demands of different sectors is necessary, particularly in areas where water resources are decreasing. In the basins where water is required for both energy production and irrigation, allocation of water resources must be planned in such a way that both objectives can be achieved. In this research, a simulation-optimization approach has been used to solve the problem of optimal planning at the watershed scale. The water evaluation and planning system (WEAP) simulation model link with the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) model for optimal long term planning at the basin scale. Therefore, the objective functions of the problem are 1) maximize the cultivation area of agricultural development sectors and 2) maximize the energy produced by the hydropower plant. The developed simulation-optimization model was employed in the problem of optimal water resources planning in the Kashkan river basin in the west of Iran. The Pareto front obtained represents the best trade-off between hydropower and agricultural development in the basin and can be used for water-energy-food nexus planning. For example one of the solutions of Pareto front, in addition to an increase of about 8\% of the objective function 2 (generated energy), the value of the objective function 1 (cultivation area) is approximately 5 times higher than the results of previous studies. This demonstrates the proper performance of the simulation-optimization model in the optimal allocation and planning of water resources at the basin scale based on the water-energy-food nexus approach.},

The paper examines the primary degradation processes in cycled cells, then proceeds to the challenges associated with controlling these processes. One key challenge is the multiplicity of complex phenomena contributing to battery aging, and the failure of most empirical battery health models to account for this multiplicity. This creates a need for identifying how batteries fail, and developing control-oriented fundamental models of their failure: a task that requires tight integration of experimental characterization techniques, system identification, and electrochemistry-based battery modeling and simulation. The paper provides an overview of battery degradation mechanisms and reactions, and the various methods used to characterize these reactions. We also highlight the battery control strategies currently in use, and the potential for long-term battery health improvements using model-based degradation control.},

We use learned models but only require observations from the environment in- stead of observations from model-predicted trajectories, minimizing the impact of compounded model errors.

For such plants, there is a potential of exhibiting multiple time scale material dynamics. An analysis framework is developed to identify the time scales where each process variable evolves and the potential manipulated inputs available in each time scale. A novel graph formalism is proposed to capture the material flow structure of such plants. Then, a graph-theoretic algorithm is developed, which mimics a singular perturbation-based time scale decomposition. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated using two example chemical plants.},

We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages.

The scenario tree is assembled from predictions of worst-case uncertainty realizations that are identified based on a first-order approximation of the process model. The key property of the presented approach is that the size of the resultant optimal control problems does not scale directly with the number of uncertain model parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach with an industrially relevant semi-batch polymerization process under parametric model uncertainty and noisy, incomplete state measurements. By allowing to account explicitly for estimation errors, the presented approach yields increased robustness when compared to nominal NMPC and a standard multistage NMPC scheme. Moreover, we investigate a combination of the presented approach with on-line estimation of uncertain model parameters alongside approximation of their confidence region to reduce the uncertainty range and consequently mitigate unnecessary conservatism. The results show that adaptation of model and uncertainty range yields considerable economic benefits without impairing the attained level of robustness for the considered process.},

  abstract = {Smart buildings have great potential for shaping an energy-efficient, sustainable, and more economic future for our planet as buildings account for approximately 40\% of the global energy consumption. Future of the smart buildings lies in using sensory data for adaptive decision making and control that is currently gloomed by the key challenge of learning a good control policy in a short period of time in an online and continuing fashion. To tackle this challenge, an event-triggered -- as opposed to classic time-triggered -- paradigm, is proposed in which learning and control decisions are made when events occur and enough information is collected. Events are characterized by certain design conditions and they occur when the conditions are met, for instance, when a certain state threshold is reached. By systematically adjusting the time of learning and control decisions, the proposed framework can potentially reduce the variance in learning, and consequently, improve the control process. We formulate the micro-climate control problem based on semi-Markov decision processes that allow for variable-time state transitions and decision making. Using extended policy gradient theorems and temporal difference methods in a reinforcement learning set-up, we propose two learning algorithms for event-triggered control of micro-climate in buildings. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach via designing a smart learning thermostat that simultaneously optimizes energy consumption and occupants' comfort in a test building.},

These sources come with hourly, daily, seasonal and yearly variations; raising the need for short and long-term energy storage technologies to guarantee the smooth and secure supply of electricity. This paper critically reviews the existing types of pumped-hydro storage plants, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration. We propose some innovative arrangements for pumped-hydro storage, which increases the possibility to find suitable locations for building large-scale reservoirs for long-term energy and water storage. Some of the proposed arrangements are compared in a case study for the upper Zambezi water basin, which has considerable water storage limitations due to its flat topography and arid climate. Results demonstrate that the proposed combined short and long-term cycles pumped-storage arrangement could be a viable solution for energy storage and reduce the cost for water storage to near zero.},

We present the first estimate of the global assessment of SPHS potential, using a novel plant-siting methodology based on high-resolution topographical and hydrological data.

This potential is unevenly distributed with mountainous regions demonstrating significantly more potential. The estimated world energy storage capacity below a cost of 50 US\$ MWh-1 is 17.3 PWh, approximately 79\% of the world electricity consumption in 2017.},

The antipodality problem consists of finding a pair of unit vectors in K achieving the maximal angle of the cone. Our attention now is focused not just in the maximal angle, but in the angular spectrum of the cone. By definition, the angular spectrum of a cone is the set of angles satisfying the stationarity (or criticality) condition associated to the maximization problem involved in the determination of the maximal angle. In the case of a polyhedral cone, the angular spectrum turns out to be a finite set. Among other results, we obtain an upper bound for the cardinality of this set.

  abstract = {Renewable energy sources and energy storage systems present specific challenges to the traditional optimal power flow (OPF) paradigm. First, storage devices require the OPF to model charge/discharge dynamics and the supply of generated power at a later time. Second, renewable energy sources necessitate that the OPF solution accounts for the control of conventional power generators in response to errors of renewable power forecast, which are significantly larger than the traditional load forecast errors. This paper presents a sparse formulation and solution for the affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) of the multi-period OPF problem. The AARC aims at operating a storage portfolio via receding horizon control; it computes the optimal base-point conventional generation and storage schedule for the forecasted load and renewable generation, together with the constrained participation factors that dictate how conventional generation and storage will adjust to maintain feasible operation whenever the renewables deviate from their forecast. The approach is demonstrated on standard IEEE networks dispatched over a 24-h horizon with interval forecasted wind power, and the feasibility of operation under interval uncertainty is validated via Monte Carlo analysis. The computational performance of the proposed approach is compared with a conventional implementation of the AARC that employs successive constraint enforcement.},

  abstract = {We investigate six different lithium-ion battery modeling approaches to highlight the importance of accurately representing batteries in decision tools. Advanced mixed-integer-linear battery models account for efficiencies as a function of the discharge power, power-limits as a function of the state-of-charge, along with degradation, which are usually not accounted for in power systems models. The revenue potential from offshore wind paired with battery systems is then examined using the more advanced representation where degradation is the sum of the capacity fades resulting from calendar- and cycle-aging. The impacts of variability of offshore wind output along with energy- and capacity-market prices are evaluated using publicly available data from 2010 to 2013 using NYISO as a test case. For 2013, results highlight that without accurate battery representations, models can overestimate battery revenues by up to 35\%, resulting primarily from degradation-tied costs. Advanced dispatch algorithms that account for calendar- and cycle-aging of the battery can help operate the battery more efficiently. Locating the battery onshore yields higher revenues and with wider useable SOC windows, it is possible to monetize higher arbitrage opportunities, which can compensate for any additional degradation-tied costs. The added value of a MWh of energy storage varies from \$2 to \$4.5 per MWh of wind energy, which leads to a breakeven cost range of \$50--115 per kWh for the battery systems. As such, energy- and capacity-market revenues were found to be insufficient in recovering the investment costs of current battery systems for the applications considered in this analysis.},

Typical figures-of-merit used for evaluating VRFBs include coulombic, voltaic, and energy efficiencies. However, these metrics along with the deliverable power vary as a function of discharge/charge current during cycling. Thus, using a basic energy storage model with constant efficiency and fixed maximum power is not a rigorous approach for predicting the performance of VRFBs in applications with variable supply/demand of electricity. Moreover, optimization based on such an oversimplified treatment may result in inaccurate battery dispatch signal and may overestimate arbitrage profit. Here, we propose a more detailed VRFB model with dynamic efficiency and maximum power limits as a function of state of charge (SOC). These data were obtained using lab-scale VRFB cells over a range of operating conditions. The dynamic model's performance is compared to the basic model for various day-ahead electricity price profiles. Substantial difference between the predictions of two modeling approaches on the battery dispatch and profits was observed. The results indicate that the dynamic model provides more accurate predictions on the battery performance for applications with intermittent energy profile.},

  abstract = {In the power distribution systems, optimal power flow (D-OPF) is formulated as a non-convex and non-linear programming (NLP) problem. Convex relaxation and linear approximation models have been increasingly adopted to achieve computational efficiency for D-OPF. Despite the benefits of scalability and global optimality, each method is based on certain assumptions, performs differently, and may lead to solutions that are physically not meaningful. In this context, this work numerically evaluates the relative performance of second-order cone programming (SOCP), semi-definite programming (SDP), and linear programming (LP) formulations of D-OPF in terms of their feasibility, optimality, and scalability with respect to NLP-based formulations. We also compare the bus injection (in bus voltage and current variables) and branch flow (in active and reactive power flow variables) based on NLP formulations. The performance is evaluated using small (123-node), medium (730-node), and large (2522-node) sized distribution feeders. Case studies, which are backed up by visualization of the analytical models for the solution space to the extent possible, show that (1) the feasibility and exactness of relaxed D-OPF formulations depend upon the problem type, (2) some NLP formulations are computationally more tractable than others, (3) different NLP formulations can converge to different local solutions, and (4) the approximate linear model may underestimate or overestimate the cost function (depending upon the problem type) and may lead to AC-infeasible solutions.},

  abstract = {There is growing interest in the use of grid-level storage to smooth variations in supply that are likely to arise with an increased use of wind and solar energy. Energy arbitrage, the process of buying, storing, and selling electricity to exploit variations in electricity spot prices, is becoming an important way of paying for expensive investments into grid-level storage. Independent system operators such as the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) require that battery storage operators place bids into an hour-ahead market (although settlements may occur in increments as small as five minutes, which is considered near ``real-time''). The operator has to place these bids without knowing the energy level in the battery at the beginning of the hour and simultaneously accounting for the value of leftover energy at the end of the hour. The problem is formulated as a dynamic program. We describe and employ a convergent approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that exploits monotonicity of the value function to find a revenue-generating bidding policy; using optimal benchmarks, we empirically show the computational benefits of the algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a distribution-free variant of the ADP algorithm that does not require any knowledge of the distribution of the price process (and makes no assumptions regarding a specific real-time price model). We demonstrate that a policy trained on historical real-time price data from the NYISO using this distribution-free approach is indeed effective.},

Therefore, as opposed to previous work in the field, there is no need for computing eigenvalues of A.

Solving these problems using interior-point methods requires the solution of a linear system that has a block-angular structure at each iteration. Parallel solution is possible using a Schur-complement decomposition. In an explicit Schur-complement decomposition, the computational cost of forming and factorizing the Schur-complement is prohibitive for problems with many coupling variables. In this paper, we show that this bottleneck can be overcome by solving the Schur-complement equations implicitly, using a quasi-Newton preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This new algorithm avoids explicit formation and factorization of the Schur-complement. The computational efficiency of this algorithm is compared with the serial full-space approach, and the serial and parallel explicit Schur-complement approach. These results show that the PCG Schur-complement approach dramatically reduces the computational cost for problems with many coupling variables.},

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a new scheme for refining during uncoarsening that is much faster than the Kernighan-Lin refinement. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme consistently produces partitions that are better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller timer (10 to 35 times faster than multilevel spectral bisection). Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it substantially outperforms the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm.},

The optimal operation of a gas pipeline network considering linepacking is determined by weighing the trade-off between storing linepack and compressor power consumption. Existing compressor performance models do not accurately capture the rigorous nonlinear operating relationships, and the more accurate widely-used models are computationally complex. This paper develops a novel integer-linear data-driven compressor performance model which is shown to be both more accurate than the best existing model, and less computationally complex. An integer-linear gas transportation model that captures future operational uncertainty using a two-stage multi-period stochastic framework is introduced and solved in a case study on a subnetwork of the Norwegian natural gas network. The case study demonstrates the novel model is highly accurate and can be optimized quickly enough for real-time decision support.},

Flow in a pipe is related to endpoint pressures by a basic Weymouth equation model, with an ideal gas equation of state, where the wave speed depends on the hydrogen concentration. At vertices, in addition to mass balance, we also consider mixing of incoming flows of varying hydrogen concentrations. The problems of interest are the heterogeneous gas flow simulation (HGFS), which determines system pressures and flows given fixed boundary conditions and compressor settings, as well as the heterogeneous gas flow optimization (HGFO), which extremizes an objective by determining optimal boundary conditions and compressor settings. We examine conditions for uniqueness of solutions to the HGFS, as well as compare and contrast mixed-integer and continuous nonlinear programming formulations for the HGFO.

Electricity and natural gas (NG), which are vital vectors of today's energy system, are likely to be coupled in different ways in the future, resulting from increasing electrification, adoption of variable renewable energy (VRE) generation in the power sector and policy factors such as cross-sectoral emissions trading. This paper develops a least-cost investment and operations model for joint planning of electricity and NG infrastructures that considers a wide range of available and emerging technology options across the two vectors, including carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipped power generation, low-carbon drop-in fuels (LCDF) as well as long-duration energy storage (LDES). The model incorporates the main operational constraints of both systems and allows each system to operate under different temporal resolutions consistent with their typical scheduling timescales. We apply the modeling framework to evaluate power-NG system outcomes for the U.S. New England region under different technology, decarbonization goals, and demand scenarios. Under a global emissions constraint, ranging between 80-95{\textbackslash}\% emissions reduction compared to 1990 levels, the least-cost solution disproportionately relies on using the available emissions budget to serve non-power NG demand and results in the power sector using only 15-43{\textbackslash}\% of the emissions budget.},

Such a fast computation is particularly useful for mitigating the negative impact of frequent load and generation fluctuations on the optimal operation of a large electrical grid. To this end, we decompose a given ACOPF problem by grid components, resulting in a large number of small independent nonlinear nonconvex optimization subproblems. The computation time of these subproblems is significantly accelerated by employing the massive parallel computing capability of GPUs. In addition, the warm-start ability of our method leads to faster convergence, making the method particularly suitable for fast tracking of optimal solutions.

  abstract = {A key element of hydrologic routing models is that the discharge-storage relationship is assumed to follow a certain mathematical form, usually a linear or a power function, with parameters calibrated based on existing inflow-outflow data. This assumption simplifies the model calibration process but also constrains model operation throughout the flow range, potentially introducing biases. We present a new nonlinear hydrologic river routing approach where functions are only required to be nondecreasing. River reaches are modeled as conceptual reservoir cascades, with discharge-storage and loss/gain functions identified by the data. A novel parameter estimation approach is developed to identify these functions and other model parameters within a dynamical optimization framework. It is shown that hydrologic routing functions indeed exhibit different mathematical forms at different regions of their active range, and that the new approach is reliable, efficient, and robust under observational uncertainty. The model is demonstrated in lake and river routing applications for the Nile River, and it is also applicable for the estimation of nonlinear, nondecreasing functional relationships of general dynamic systems in state-space form.},

We discuss the design principles and implementation details for our kernel function and core operations. Different design choices are justified by numerical experiments. By using the application of distributed control of alternating current optimal power flow, where a large problem is decomposed into many smaller nonlinear programs using a Lagrangian approach, we demonstrate computational performance of ExaTron on the Summit supercomputer at Oak RidgeNational Laboratory.

Despite decades of research on infrastructure failures, the impact of job failures across different scales remains unclear. This paper presents a view of managing two large, multi-tenant ML clusters, providing quantitative analysis, operational experience, and our own perspective in understanding and addressing reliability concerns at scale. Our analysis reveals that while large jobs are most vulnerable to failures, smaller jobs make up the majority of jobs in the clusters and should be incorporated into optimization objectives. We identify key workload properties, compare them across clusters, and demonstrate essential reliability requirements for pushing the boundaries of ML training at scale. We hereby introduce a taxonomy of failures and key reliability metrics, analyze 11 months of data from two state-of-the-art ML environments with over 150 million A100 GPU hours and 4 million jobs. Building on our data, we fit a failure model to project Mean Time to Failure for various GPU scales. We further propose a method to estimate a related metric, Effective Training Time Ratio, as a function of job parameters, and we use this model to gauge the efficacy of potential software mitigations at scale. Our work provides valuable insights and future research directions for improving the reliability of AI supercomputer clusters, emphasizing the need for flexible, workload-agnostic, and reliability-aware infrastructure, system software, and algorithms.},

  abstract = {Distributed energy storage devices are commonly employed as an effective approach for addressing operational challenges introduced by the large scale integration of renewables. However, the modeling of storage devices results in intertemporal coupling of the individual optimal power flow (OPF) problems defined at each subdivision of the time period of interest. The resulting multiperiod optimal power flow (MPOPF) problem becomes intractable prohibiting, forecasting, and planning over long time periods. Interior point (IP) methods have been extensively employed for the solution of OPF and MPOPF problems. This work proposes an efficient IP algorithm, BELTISTOS, particularly designed for MPOPF problems. The structure of the linear system associated with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions is revisited, and a Schur-complement-based approach tailored to its structure is proposed. Through benchmark cases involving power-grid models of increasing complexity, the BELTISTOS algorithm is demonstrated to provide several orders of magnitude faster solution times than standard optimization methods, such as IPOPT, MIPS, and KNITRO, using significantly less memory.},

Usually, the resulting instances are too challenging to be solved by state-of-the-art MINLP solvers. In this paper, we use graph decompositions to obtain multiple optimization problems on smaller blocks, which can be solved in parallel and may result in simpler classes of optimization problems because not every block necessarily contains mixed-integer or nonlinear aspects. For achieving feasibility at the interfaces of the several blocks, we employ a tailored consensus-based penalty alternating direction method. Our numerical results show that such decomposition techniques can outperform the baseline approach of just solving the overall MINLP from scratch. However, a complete answer to the question of how to decompose MINLPs on graphs in dependence of the given model is still an open topic for future research.

  abstract = {A stochastic model predictive control (MPC) framework is presented to determine real-time commitments in energy and frequency regulation markets for a stationary battery while simultaneously mitigating long-term demand charges for an attached load. The control problem is multi-scale in nature and poses challenges on computational tractability of the stochastic program and of forecasting and uncertainty quantification (UQ) procedures. The framework deals with tractability of the stochastic program by using a discounting factor for long-term demand charges, while a Ledoit--Wolf covariance estimator is used to overcome UQ tractability issues. The performance of stochastic MPC is benchmarked against that of perfect information MPC and deterministic MPC for different prediction horizon lengths and demand charge discounting strategies. A case study using real load data for a typical university campus and price and regulation data from PJM is considered. It is found that stochastic MPC can recover 83\% of the ideal value of the battery, which is defined as the expected savings obtained by operating the battery under perfect information MPC. In contrast, deterministic MPC can only recover 73\% of this ideal value. It is also found that operating the battery under stochastic MPC improves the battery payback period by 12.1\%, while operating it under perfect information improves it by 27.9\%.},

Here, we derive an analytical solution to the decision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation power to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets. Mathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional uncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain the expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow storage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the future. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on day-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid operators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to be purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing frequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the expected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with frequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency regulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly inversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be committed.},

  abstract = {Energy systems and manufacturing processes of the 21st century are becoming increasingly dynamic and interconnected, which require new capabilities to effectively model and optimize their design and operations. Such next generation computational tools must leverage state-of-the-art techniques in optimization and be able to rapidly incorporate new advances. To address these requirements, we have developed the Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) Integrated Platform, which builds on the strengths of both process simulators (model libraries) and algebraic modeling languages (advanced solvers). This paper specifically presents the IDAES Core Modeling Framework (IDAES-CMF), along with a case study demonstrating the application of the framework to solve process optimization problems. Capabilities provided by this framework include a flexible, modifiable, open-source platform for optimization of process flowsheets utilizing state-of-the-art solvers and solution techniques, fully open and extensible libraries of dynamic unit operations models and thermophysical property models, and integrated support for superstructure-based conceptual design and optimization under uncertainty.},

We also outline an automated rewriting system between equivalent formulations of a constraint. MathOptInterface has been implemented in practice, forming the foundation of a recent rewrite of JuMP, an open-source algebraic modeling language in the Julia language. The regularity of the MathOptInterface representation leads naturally to a general file format for mathematical optimization we call MathOptFormat. In addition, the automated rewriting system provides modeling power to users while making it easy to connect new solvers to JuMP. Summary of Contribution: This paper describes a new abstract data structure for representing mathematical optimization models with a corresponding file format and automatic transformation system. The advances are useful for algebraic modeling languages, allowing practitioners to model problems more naturally and more generally than before.},

With increasing reliance on variable renewable energy resources, energy storage is likely to play a critical accompanying role to help balance generation and consumption patterns. As grid planners, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, policy makers, regulators and other key stakeholders commonly use capacity expansion modelling to inform energy policy and investment decisions, it is crucial that these processes capture the value of energy storage in energy-system decarbonization. Here we conduct an extensive review of literature on the representation of energy storage in capacity expansion modelling. We identify challenges related to enhancing modelling capabilities to inform decarbonization policies and electricity system investments, and to improve societal outcomes throughout the clean energy transition. We further identify corresponding research activities that can help overcome these challenges and conclude by highlighting tangible real-world outcomes that will result from pursuing these research activities.},

RO is dedicated to solving optimization problems subject to uncertainty: design constraints must be satisfied for all the values of the uncertain parameters within a given uncertainty set. Uncertainty sets may be modeled as deterministic sets (boxes, polyhedra, ellipsoids), in which case the RO problem may be reformulated via worst-case analysis, or as families of distributions. The challenge of RO is to reformulate or approximate robust constraints so that the uncertain optimization problem is transformed into a tractable deterministic optimization problem. Most reformulation methods assume linearity of the robust constraints or uncertainty sets of favorable shape, which represents only a fraction of real-world applications. This survey addresses nonlinear RO and includes problem formulations and applications, solution approaches, and available software with code samples.},

In this paper, we present a two-step framework to evaluate the potential value of energy storage in power systems with renewable generation. First, we formulate a stochastic unit commitment approach with wind power forecast uncertainty and energy storage. Second, the solution from the stochastic unit commitment is used to derive a flexible schedule for energy storage in economic dispatch where the look-ahead horizon is limited. Analysis is conducted on the IEEE 24-bus system to demonstrate the benefits of battery storage in systems with renewable resources and the effectiveness of the proposed battery operation strategy.}

The TGP is the world's largest and most complex hydropower system in operation. The objective is to minimize the total operational cost. The decision variables are the startup or shutdown of each of the available units in the system and the power releases from the online units. The mathematical formulation must take into account the head variation over the operation periods as the net head changes from hour to hour and affects power generation. Additionally, the formulation must consider the operation of 32 heterogeneous generating units and the nonlinear power generation function of each unit. A three-dimensional interpolation technique is used to accurately represent the nonlinear power generation function of each individual unit, taking into account the time-varying head as well as the non-smooth limitations for power output and power release. With the aid of integer variables that represent the on/off and operation partition statuses of a unit, the developed HUC model for the TGP conforms to a standard mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. We demonstrate the performance and utility of the model by analyzing the results from several scenarios for the TGP.},

Thus, our pipeline reduces the study of MPC to the well-studied problem of perturbation analysis, enabling the derivation of regret bounds of MPC under a variety of settings. To demonstrate the power of our pipeline, we use it to generalize existing regret bounds on MPC in linear time-varying (LTV) systems to incorporate prediction errors on costs, dynamics, and disturbances. Further, our pipeline leads to regret bounds on MPC in systems with nonlinear dynamics and constraints.},

Our case study of the China Southern Power Grid reveals that, in a 2050 net-zero grid, simply adapting hydropower operations to balance VRE can reduce 2018--2050 total system costs by 7\% (that is, US\$28.2 billion) and simultaneously save 123.8\,km3 of water each year (that is, more than three times the reservoir capacity of the Three Gorges Dam).

Our LP-based method is up to 3,822 times faster than the monolithic approach and up to 55 times faster than the GBD.

Small efficiency improvements in this domain have the potential to lead to billions of dollars of cost savings, and significant reductions in emissions from fossil fuel generators. Recent work on data-driven solution methods for AC-OPF shows the potential for large speed improvements compared to traditional solvers; however, no large-scale open datasets for this problem exist. We present the largest readily-available collection of solved AC-OPF problems to date. This collection is orders of magnitude larger than existing readily-available datasets, allowing training of high-capacity data-driven models. Uniquely, it includes topological perturbations - a critical requirement for usage in realistic power grid operations. We hope this resource will spur the community to scale research to larger grid sizes with variable topology.},

This work is motivated by an application in stochastic optimization problems with recourse, but the proposed approach can be used for a large family of dense saddle-point systems, in particular, for those arising in convex programming. Although stochastic optimization problems have many important applications, they can present serious computational difficulties. In particular, sample average approximation (SAA) problems with a large number of samples are often too big to solve on a single shared-memory system. Recent work has developed interior-point methods and specialized linear algebra to solve these problems in parallel, using a scenario-based decomposition that distributes the data, and work across computational nodes. Even for sparse SAA problems, the decomposition produces a dense and possibly very large saddle-point linear system that must be solved repeatedly. We developed a specialized parallel factorization procedure for these systems, together with a streamlined method for assembling the distributed dense matrix. Strong scaling tests indicate over 90\% efficiency on 1024 cores on a stochastic unit commitment problem with 57 million variables. Stochastic unit commitment problems with up to 189 million variables are solved efficiently on up to 2048 cores.},

Stochastic programming is used to make decisions in the present while incorporating a model of uncertainty about future events (scenarios). These problems present serious computational difficulties as the number of scenarios becomes large and the complexity of the system and planning horizons increase, necessitating the use of parallel computing. Our novel hybrid parallel implementation PIPS is based on interior-point methods and uses a Schur complement technique to obtain a scenario-based decomposition of the linear algebra. PIPS is applied to a stochastic economic dispatch problem that uses hourly wind forecasts and a detailed physical power flow model. Solving this problem is necessary for efficient integration of wind power with the Illinois power grid and real-time energy market.

Its computational results demonstrate the significant computational advantages of the GPU-based first-order algorithm on certain large-scale problems. The average performance also achieves a level close to commercial solvers for the first time in history. However, due to limitations in experimental hardware and the disadvantage of implementing the algorithm in Julia compared to C language, neither the commercial solver nor cuPDLP reached their maximum efficiency. Therefore, in this report, we have re-implemented and optimized cuPDLP in C language. Utilizing state-of-the-art CPU and GPU hardware, we extensively compare cuPDLP with the best commercial solvers. The experiments further highlight its substantial computational advantages and potential for solving large-scale linear programming problems.

  abstract = {Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning is currently drawing increasing research interest, driven by the rapid deployment of deep neural networks across different fields, such as computer vision and natural language processing, and by the need for reliable tools in risk-sensitive applications. Recently, various machine learning models have also been developed to tackle problems in the field of scientific computing with applications to computational science and engineering (CSE). Physics-informed neural networks and deep operator networks are two such models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and learning operator mappings, respectively. In this regard, a comprehensive study of UQ methods tailored specifically for scientific machine learning (SciML) models has been provided in [A. F. Psaros et al., J. Comput. Phys., 477 (2023), art. 111902]. Nevertheless, and despite their theoretical merit, implementations of these methods are not straightforward, especially in large-scale CSE applications, hindering their broad adoption in both research and industry settings. In this paper, we present an open-source Python library ({\u u}lhttps://github.com/Crunch-UQ4MI), termed NeuralUQ and accompanied by an educational tutorial, for employing UQ methods for SciML in a convenient and structured manner. The library, designed for both educational and research purposes, supports multiple modern UQ methods and SciML models. It is based on a succinct workflow and facilitates flexible employment and easy extensions by the users. We first present a tutorial of NeuralUQ and subsequently demonstrate its applicability and efficiency in four diverse examples, involving dynamical systems and high-dimensional parametric and time-dependent PDEs.},

The sequence of dynamics matrices can be arbitrary, but with a total variation, V\_T, assumed to be o(T) and unknown to the controller. Under the assumption that a sequence of stabilizing, but potentially sub-optimal controllers is available for all t, we present an algorithm that achieves the optimal dynamic regret of O(V\_T{\textasciicircum}2/5 T{\textasciicircum}3/5 ). With piecewise constant dynamics, our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of O(sqrtST ) where S is the number of switches. The crux of our algorithm is an adaptive non-stationarity detection strategy, which builds on an approach recently developed for contextual Multi-armed Bandit problems. We also argue that non-adaptive forgetting (e.g., restarting or using sliding window learning with a static window size) may not be regret optimal for the LQR problem, even when the window size is optimally tuned with the knowledge of \$V\_T\$. The main technical challenge in the analysis of our algorithm is to prove that the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator has a small bias when the parameter to be estimated is non-stationary. Our analysis also highlights that the key motif driving the regret is that the LQR problem is in spirit a bandit problem with linear feedback and locally quadratic cost. This motif is more universal than the LQR problem itself, and therefore we believe our results should find wider application.},

MTK blurs the lines of traditional symbolic computing by acting directly on a user's numerical code. We show the ability to apply graph algorithms for automatically parallelizing and performing index reduction on code written for differential-algebraic equation (DAE) solvers, "fixing" the performance and stability of the model without requiring any changes to on the user's part. We demonstrate how composable model transformations can be combined with automated data-driven surrogate generation techniques, allowing machine learning methods to generate accelerated approximate models within an acausal modeling framework. These reduced models are shown to outperform the Dymola Modelica compiler on an HVAC model by 590x at 3{\textbackslash}\% error. Together, this demonstrates MTK as a system for bringing the latest research in graph transformations directly to modeling applications.},

Furthermore, in the fully observed Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), our result improves upon recent work by Dean et al., who present an algorithm achieving a sub-optimality gap linear in the parameter error.

The NCL algorithm is implemented in AMPL and tested on large instances of a tax policy model that could not be solved directly by the state-of-the-art solvers that we tested, because of singularity in the Jacobian of the active constraints. Algorithm NCL with IPOPT as subproblem solver proves to be effective, with IPOPT using second derivatives and successfully warm starting each subproblem.},

Coordination applies to real situations, where wind power and hydropower are owned by different utilities, sharing the same transmission lines, though hydropower has priority for transmission capacity. Coordination is thus necessary to minimize wind energy curtailments during congestion situations. The planning algorithm accounts for the uncertainty of wind power forecasts and power market price uncertainty. Planning for the spot market and the regulating market is considered in the algorithm. The planning algorithm is applied to a case study and the results are summarized in the paper.},

We consider three definitions of robustness for nonlinear systems and bounded disturbances: robustly asymptotically stable (RAS), robustly asymptotically stable in expectation (RASiE), and RASiE with respect to the stage cost ({$\cdot$}) used in these MPC formulations ( -RASiE). Via input-to-state stability (ISS) and stochastic ISS (SISS) Lyapunov functions, we establish that MPC, subject to sufficiently small disturbances, and CMPC ensure all three definitions of robustness without a stochastic objective function. While SMPC is RASiE and -RASiE, SMPC is not neccesarily RAS for nonlinear systems. Through a few simple examples, we illustrate the implications of these results and demonstrate that, depending on the definition of robustness considered, SMPC is not necessarily more robust than nominal MPC even if the disturbance model is exact.},

The novelty behind the algorithm's performance involves an iterative scenario design approach that merges information regarding constraint violations in the system with data-driven sparse regression. Compared to conventional methods with random scenario sampling, our approach is able to provide feasible operating points for realistic systems with much lower sample requirements. Furthermore, multiple sub-tasks in our approach can be easily paralleled and based on historical data to enhance its performance and application. We demonstrate the computational improvements of our approach through simulations on different test cases in the IEEE PES PGLib-OPF benchmark library.},

We model the optimal dispatch of supply and demand in natural gas networks, with different objective functions, i.e., maximization of flow, and different economic surpluses. The models take into account the physical structure of the transportation networks, and examine the implications it has for economic analysis. More specifically, pressure constraints create system effects, and thus, changes in one part of the system may require significant changes elsewhere. The proposed network flow model for natural gas takes into account pressure drops and system effects when representing network flows. Pressure drops and pipeline flows are modeled by the Weymouth equation. A linearization of the Weymouth equation makes economic analyses computationally feasible even for large networks. However, in this paper, the importance of combining economics with a model for pressure drops and system effects is illustrated by small numerical examples.},

As these data-driven surrogate models must be integrated into a larger process optimization problem, we discuss the verification problem, i.e., checking that the optimum of the surrogate corresponds to the optimum of the truth model.

  abstract = {In many engineered systems, optimization is used for decision making at time scales ranging from real-time operation to long-term planning. This process often involves solving similar optimization problems over and over again with slightly modified input parameters, often under tight latency requirements. We consider the problem of using the information available through this repeated solution process to learn important characteristics of the optimal solution as a function of the input parameters. Our proposed method is based on learning relevant sets of active constraints, from which the optimal solution can be obtained efficiently. Using active sets as features preserves information about the physics of the system, enables interpretable results, accounts for relevant safety constraints, and is easy to represent and encode. However, the total number of active sets is also very large, as it grows exponentially with system size. The key contribution of this paper is a streaming algorithm that learns the relevant active sets from training samples consisting of the input parameters and the corresponding optimal solution, without any restrictions on the problem type, problem structure or probability distribution of the input parameters. The algorithm comes with theoretical performance guarantees and is shown to converge fast for problem instances with a small number of relevant active sets. It can thus be used to establish simultaneously learn the relevant active sets and the practicability of the learning method. Through case studies in optimal power flow, supply chain planning, and shortest path routing, we demonstrate that often only a few active sets are relevant in practice, suggesting that active sets provide an appropriate level of abstraction for a learning algorithm to target.},

We also discuss strategies for computing sparse Jacobians and Hessians on GPUs for nonlinear programming. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the scalability of GPU-based optimization solvers.

  abstract = {We present a GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL, an augmented Lagrangian method for solving large-scale and degenerate nonlinear programs. Although interior-point methods and sequential quadratic programming are widely used for solving nonlinear programs, the augmented Lagrangian method is known to offer superior robustness against constraint degeneracies and can rapidly detect infeasibility. We introduce several enhancements to Algorithm NCL, including fusion of the inner and outer loops and use of extrapolation steps, which improve both efficiency and convergence stability. Further, NCL has the key advantage of being well-suited for GPU architectures because of the regularity of the KKT systems provided by quadratic penalty terms. In particular, the NCL subproblem formulation allows the KKT systems to be naturally expressed as either stabilized or condensed KKT systems, whereas the interior-point approach requires aggressive reformulations or relaxations to make it suitable for GPUs. Both systems can be efficiently solved on GPUs using sparse {\textbackslash}ldlt factorization with static pivoting, as implemented in NVIDIA cuDSS. Building on these advantages, we examine the KKT systems arising from NCL subproblems. We present an optimized GPU implementation of Algorithm NCL by leveraging MadNLP as an interior-point subproblem solver and utilizing the stabilized and condensed formulations of the KKT systems for computing Newton steps. Numerical experiments on various large-scale and degenerate NLPs, including optimal power flow, COPS benchmarks, and security-constrained optimal power flow, demonstrate that MadNCL operates efficiently on GPUs while effectively managing problem degeneracy, including MPCC constraints.},

  abstract = {Applying differentiable programming techniques and machine learning algorithms to foreign programs requires developers to either rewrite their code in a machine learning framework, or otherwise provide derivatives of the foreign code. This paper presents Enzyme, a high-performance automatic differentiation (AD) compiler plugin for the LLVM compiler framework capable of synthesizing gradients of statically analyzable programs expressed in the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Enzyme synthesizes gradients for programs written in any language whose compiler targets LLVM IR including C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift, MLIR, etc., thereby providing native AD capabilities in these languages. Unlike traditional source-to-source and operator-overloading tools, Enzyme performs AD on optimized IR. On a machine-learning focused benchmark suite including Microsoft's ADBench, AD on optimized IR achieves a geometric mean speedup of 4.2 times over AD on IR before optimization allowing Enzyme to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Packaging Enzyme for PyTorch and TensorFlow provides convenient access to gradients of foreign code with state-of-the-art performance, enabling foreign code to be directly incorporated into existing machine learning workflows.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the structural properties of optimal control of spatially distributed systems. Such systems consist of an infinite collection of possibly heterogeneous linear control systems that are spatially interconnected via certain distant-dependent coupling functions over arbitrary graphs. We study the structural properties of optimal control problems with infinite-horizon linear quadratic criteria, by analyzing the spatial structure of the solution to the corresponding operator Lyapunov and Riccati equations. The key idea of the paper is the introduction of a special class of operators called spatially decaying (SD). These operators are a generalization of translation invariant operators used in the study of spatially invariant systems. We prove that given a control system with a state-space representation consisting of SD operators, the solution of operator Lyapunov and Riccati equations are SD. Furthermore, we show that the kernel of the optimal state feedback for each subsystem decays in the spatial domain, with the type of decay (e.g., exponential, polynomial or logarithmic) depending on the type of coupling between subsystems.},

  abstract = {Automated fault detection (FD) methods are essential for safe and profitable operation of complex engineered systems. Both data-driven and model-based methods have been extensively studied, and some are widely used in practice. However, distinguishing faults from acceptable process variations remains a critical challenge, making both false alarms and missed faults commonplace. In principle, set-based FD methods can rigorously address this challenge. However, existing methods are often much too conservative, particularly for nonlinear systems. Moreover, few if any published comparisons clearly demonstrate the supposed advantages of set-based methods relative to conventional methods. This paper first presents a new set-based FD method based on discrete-time differential inequalities and demonstrates increased fault sensitivity through several case studies. Next, a detailed comparison of set-based methods with representative data-driven and model-based approaches is presented. The results verify some key advantages of the set-based approaches, but also highlight key challenges for future work.},

  abstract = {Controllability and observability criteria provide an answer to the binary question of whether or not a linear dynamical system is completely controllable and/or completely observable. However, these criteria do not associate or identify a degree of quality of complete controllability or complete observability. Therefore, the problem of assigning physically meaningful measures of the quality of controllability and observability is considered here. Three physical measures---determinant, trace, and maximal eigenvalue of the inverse characteristic controllability or observability matrix---are imbedded in a set of measures which is defined as the set of certain means related to the eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix. By this measure concept, the qualities of controllability and observability are maximized with respect to certain adjustable structural parameters of the dynamical system. Some illustrative applications in satellite attitude control problems are discussed in detail. R{\'e}sum{\'e} Les crit{\`e}res d'aptitude {\`a} la commande et d'aptitude {\`a} l'observation fournissent une reponse {\`a} la double question de savoir si un syst{\`e}me dynamique lin{\'e}aire peut ou non {\^e}tre compl{\`e}tement command{\'e} et/ou {\^e}tre compl{\`e}tement observ{\'e}. Toutefois, ces crit{\`e}res ne comportent pas et n'identifient pas un degr{\'e} de qualit{\'e} d'aptitude compl{\`e}te {\`a} la commande ou d'aptitude compl{\`e}te {\`a} l'observation. L'article consid{\`e}re en cons{\'e}quence le probl{\`e}me d'assigner des m{\'e}sures ayant une signification physique {\`a} la qualit{\'e} d'aptitude {\`a} la commande et d'aptitude {\`a} l'observation. Trois mesures physiques---le d{\'e}terminant, le trac{\'e} et la valeur propre maximale de la matrice caract{\'e}ristique inverse d'aptitude {\`a} la commande ou de l'aptitude {\`a} l'observation---sont contenues dans une s{\'e}rie de mesures qui est d{\'e}finie comme une s{\'e}rie de certaines moyennes li{\'e}es aux valeurs propres de la matrice caract{\'e}ristique. A l'aide de ce concept de mesure, les qualit{\'e}s d'aptitude {\`a} la commande et d'aptitude {\`a} l'observation sont maximalis{\'e}es par rapport {\`a} certains param{\`e}tres r{\`e}glables de la structure du syst{\`e}me dynamique. Certaines applications, prises {\`a} titre d'exemple, dans les probl{\`e}mes de commande d'altitude de satellites sont discut{\'e}es en d{\'e}tail. Zusammenfassung Kriterien der Kontrollierbarkeit und der Beobachtungsm{\"o}glichkeit geben die Antwort auf die bin{\"a}re Frage, ob oder ob nicht ein lineares, dynamisches System v{\"o}llig kontrollierbar und/oder v{\"o}llig zu beobachten ist. Trotzdem verbinden oder bezeichnen diese Kriterien nicht einen Qualit{\"a}tsgrad f{\"u}r v{\"o}llige Kontrollierbarkeit oder v{\"o}llige M{\"o}glichkeit der Beobachtung. Daher wird das Problem hier betrachtet, physische bedeutungsvolle Messungen der Qualit{\"a}t der Kontrollierbarkeit und der M{\"o}glichkeit der Beobachtung festzulegen. Drei physische Masst{\"a}be---Determinante, Spur und maximaler Eigenwert der inversen, charakteristischen Kontrollierbarkeit---oder Beobachtungsm{\"o}glichkeitmatrix---sind in einem Satz von Messungen eingeschlossen, der als der Satz bestimmter, auf die Eigenwerte der charakteristischen Matrix bezogenen Mittel definiert wird. Durch diese Auffassung der Bemessung werden die Eigenschaften der Kontrollierbarkeit und Beobachtungsm{\"o}glichkeit mit Bezug auf bestimmte, verstellbare, strukturelle Parameter des dynamischen Systems maximalisiert. Einige illustrierende Anwendungen in Kontrollproblemen des Verhaltens von Satelliten werden in Einzelheiten besprochen. {\cyrchar\CYRR}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrf}{\cyrchar\cyre}{\cyrchar\cyrr}{\cyrchar\cyra}{\cyrchar\cyrt} {\cyrchar\CYRK}p{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrt}ep{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyri} y{\cyrchar\cyrp}pa{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrya}e{\cyrchar\cyrm}oc{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyrn}a{\cyrchar\cyrb}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyryu}{\cyrchar\cyrd}ae{\cyrchar\cyrm}oc{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyrd}a{\cyrchar\cyryu}{\cyrchar\cyrt} o{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrv}e{\cyrchar\cyrt} {\cyrchar\cyrn}a {\cyrchar\cyrd}{\cyrchar\cyrv}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt}{\cyrchar\cyrn}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt} {\cyrchar\cyrv}o{\cyrchar\cyrp}poc o {\cyrchar\cyrv}o{\cyrchar\cyrz}{\cyrchar\cyrm}o{\cyrchar\cyrzh}{\cyrchar\cyrn}oc{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyrn}e{\cyrchar\cyrv}o{\cyrchar\cyrz}{\cyrchar\cyrm}o{\cyrchar\cyrzh}{\cyrchar\cyrn}oc{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyrd}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrya} {\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrn}e{\cyrchar\cyrishrt}{\cyrchar\cyrn}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt} {\cyrchar\cyrd}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrn}a{\cyrchar\cyrm}{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrch}ec{\cyrchar\cyrk}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt} c{\cyrchar\cyri}c{\cyrchar\cyrt}e{\cyrchar\cyrm}{\cyrchar\cyrery} {\cyrchar\cyrb}{\cyrchar\cyrery}{\cyrchar\cyrt}{\cyrchar\cyrsftsn} {\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrp}o{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrn}e y{\cyrchar\cyrp}pa{\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrya}e{\cyrchar\cyrm}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt} {\cyrchar\cyri}/{\cyrchar\cyri}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyri} {\cyrchar\cyrv}{\cyrchar\cyrp}o{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyrn}e {\cyrchar\cyrn}a{\cyrchar\cyrb}{\cyrchar\cyrl}{\cyrchar\cyryu}{\cyrchar\cyrd}ae{\cyrchar\cyrm}o{\cyrchar\cyrishrt}.

  abstract = {We study the convergence properties of an overlapping Schwarz decomposition algorithm for solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs). The algorithm decomposes the time domain into a set of overlapping subdomains, and solves all subproblems defined over subdomains in parallel. The convergence is attained by updating primal-dual information at the boundaries of overlapping subdomains. We show that the algorithm exhibits local linear convergence, and that the convergence rate improves exponentially with the overlap size. We also establish global convergence results for a general quadratic programming, which enables the application of the Schwarz scheme inside second-order optimization algorithms (e.g., sequential quadratic programming). The theoretical foundation of our convergence analysis is a sensitivity result of nonlinear OCPs, which we call ``exponential decay of sensitivity'' (EDS). Intuitively, EDS states that the impact of perturbations at domain boundaries (i.e., initial and terminal time) on the solution decays exponentially as one moves into the domain. Here, we expand a previous analysis available in the literature by showing that EDS holds for both primal and dual solutions of nonlinear OCPs, under uniform second-order sufficient condition, controllability condition, and boundedness condition. We conduct experiments with a quadrotor motion planning problem and a partial differential equations (PDE) control problem to validate our theory, and show that the approach is significantly more efficient than alternating direction method of multipliers and as efficient as the centralized interior-point solver.},

We show that for a given pair of nodes, the sensitivity of the primal-dual solution at one node against a data perturbation at the other node decays exponentially with respect to the distance between these two nodes on the graph. In other words, the solution sensitivity decays as one moves away from the perturbation point. This result, which we call exponential decay of sensitivity, holds under the strong second-order sufficiency condition and the linear independence constraint qualification. We also present conditions under which the decay rate remains uniformly bounded; this allows us to characterize the sensitivity behavior of NLPs defined over subgraphs of infinite graphs.

  abstract = {We propose a fast temporal decomposition procedure for solving long-horizon nonlinear dynamic programs. The core of the procedure is sequential quadratic programming (SQP) that utilizes a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian as the merit function. Within each SQP iteration, we approximately solve the Newton system using an overlapping temporal decomposition strategy. We show that the approximate search direction is still a descent direction of the augmented Lagrangian provided the overlap size and penalty parameters are suitably chosen, which allows us to establish the global convergence. Moreover, we show that a unit step size is accepted locally for the approximate search direction and further establish a uniform, local linear convergence over stages. This local convergence rate matches the rate of the recent Schwarz scheme (Na et al. 2022). However, the Schwarz scheme has to solve nonlinear subproblems to optimality in each iteration, whereas we only perform a single Newton step instead. Numerical experiments validate our theories and demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Since the respective compute back end can be selected at runtime, one can seamlessly switch between different hardware types without the need for error-prone and time-consuming recompilation steps. We present new benchmark results for sparse linear algebra operations in ViennaCL, complementing results for the dense linear algebra operations in ViennaCL reported in earlier work. Comparisons with vendor libraries show that ViennaCL provides better overall performance for sparse matrix-vector and sparse matrix-matrix products. Additional benchmark results for pipelined iterative solvers with kernel fusion and preconditioners identify the respective sweet spots for CPUs, Xeon Phis, and GPUs.},

The classical optimization methodology works under the premise that all problem data are available to a central entity (a computing agent or node). However, this premise does not apply to large networked systems, where each agent (node) in the network typically has access only to its private local information and has only a local view of the network structure. This review surveys the development of such distributed computational models for time-varying networks. To emphasize the role of the network structure in these approaches, we focus on a simple direct primal (sub)gradient method, but we also provide an overview of other distributed methods for optimization in networks. Applications of the distributed optimization framework to the control of power systems, least squares solutions to linear equations, and model predictive control are also presented.},

Power system operators, along with several other actors, are increasingly using Optimal Power Flow (OPF) algorithms for a wide number of applications, including planning and real-time operations. However, in its original form, the AC OPF problem is often challenging to solve as it is non-linear and non-convex. Besides the large number of approximations and relaxations, recent efforts have also been focusing on Machine Learning approaches, especially neural networks. So far, however, these approaches have only partially considered the wide number of physical models available during training. And, more importantly, they have offered no guarantees about potential constraint violations of their output. Our approach (i) introduces a framework to incorporate AC power flow equations inside neural network training and (ii) integrates methods that rigorously determine and reduce the worst-case constraint violations across the entire input domain, while maintaining the optimality of the prediction. We demonstrate how physics-informed neural networks achieve higher accuracy and lower constraint violations than standard neural networks, and show how we can further reduce the worst-case violations for all neural networks.},

GsNLPs are problems in which the objective and constraint functions are associated with a graph node, and they depend only on the variables of adjacent nodes. This graph-structured formulation encompasses various specific instances, such as dynamic optimization, PDE-constrained optimization, multi-stage stochastic optimization, and optimization over networks. We propose a globally convergent overlapping graph decomposition method for solving large-scale gsNLPs under the standard regularity assumptions and mild conditions on the graph topology. At each iteration step, we use an overlapping graph decomposition to compute an approximate Newton step direction using parallel computations. We then select a suitable step size and update the primal-dual iterates by performing backtracking line search with the exact augmented Lagrangian merit function. By exploiting the exponential decay of sensitivity of gsNLPs, we show that the approximate Newton direction is a descent direction of the augmented Lagrangian merit function, which leads to global convergence and fast local convergence. In particular, global convergence is achieved for sufficiently large overlaps, and the local linear convergence rate improves exponentially in terms of the overlap size. This result matches existing results for dynamic programs. We validate our theory with an elliptic PDE-constrained problem.},

After discretizations both inputs and outputs are high-dimensional. We aim to approximate not only the operators with improved accuracy but also their derivatives (Jacobians) with respect to the input function-valued parameter to empower derivative-based algorithms in many applications, e.g., Bayesian inverse problems, optimization under parameter uncertainty, and optimal experimental design. The major difficulties include the computational cost of generating derivative training data and the high dimensionality of the problem leading to large training cost. To address these challenges, we exploit the intrinsic low-dimensionality of the derivatives and develop algorithms for compressing derivative information and efficiently imposing it in neural operator training yielding derivative-informed neural operators. We demonstrate that these advances can significantly reduce the costs of both data generation and training for large classes of problems (e.g., nonlinear steady state parametric PDE maps), making the costs marginal or comparable to the costs without using derivatives, and in particular independent of the discretization dimension of the input and output functions. Moreover, we show that the proposed DINO achieves significantly higher accuracy than neural operators trained without derivative information, for both function approximation and derivative approximation (e.g., Gauss--Newton Hessian), especially when the training data are limited.},

  abstract = {Solid sorbent-based CO2 capture from flue gas provides a novel alternative to traditional solvent-based processes due to potentially lower energy consumption for regeneration. Optimal operation of such a gas-solid flow process requires an advanced control framework for efficient disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking. This work focuses on the development of computationally fast and accurate dynamic reduced models (D-RMs) and the application of these models to nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithms. Two different types of D-RMs are developed: the first type is a data-driven model where step-test data are utilized to generate the D-RM through the Decoupled A-B Net (DABNet) model, and the second type of D-RM is a temporal and spatial reduction of the original process model to improve its computational efficiency while still retaining its physics. Disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking characteristics of the NMPC and its computational performance are studied for both types of DRMs. In addition, performance of both NMPC formulations are compared with linear model predictive control (LMPC) formulations.},

Better understanding of the interactions between landscape-related decisions and the design of biorefineries with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in a supply chain context is needed to enable efficient systems. Here we analyse the cost and greenhouse gas mitigation potential for cellulosic biofuel supply chains in the US Midwest using realistic spatially explicit land availability and crop productivity data and consider fuel conversion technologies with detailed CCS design for their associated CO2 streams. Optimization methods identify trade-offs and design strategies leading to systems with attractive environmental and economic performance. Strategic and operational decisions depend on underlying spatial features and are sensitive to biofuel demand and CCS incentives. US CCS incentives neglect to motivate greenhouse gas mitigation from all supply chain emission sources, which leverage spatial interactions between CCS, electricity prices and the biomass landscape.},

The dispatch schedules are determined by solving power flow calculations that incorporate models of the network components in real time as the power grid conditions change. Electricity intensive chemical processes can potentially provide grid support services and a closer coordination between process and grid operations can be beneficial. This cooperation is hindered by the lack of suitable process models, which appropriately protect process information. We propose a means to model the grid-relevant dynamics of chemical processes, and a framework for embedding such models in optimal power flow calculations. We present an extensive case study concerning cooperative demand-response operation for an electricity-intensive chemical process, chlor-alkali production. The results indicate significant flexibility and economic benefits both at the utility and at the end-user levels.},

  abstract = {The interior-point method (IPM) has become the workhorse method for nonlinear programming. The performance of IPM is directly related to the linear solver employed to factorize the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system at each iteration of the algorithm. When solving large-scale nonlinear problems, state-of-the art IPM solvers rely on efficient sparse linear solvers to solve the KKT system. Instead, we propose a novel reduced-space IPM algorithm that condenses the KKT system into a dense matrix whose size is proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the problem. Depending on where the reduction occurs, we derive two variants of the reduced-space method: linearize-then-reduce and reduce-then-linearize. We adapt their workflow so that the vast majority of computations are accelerated on GPUs. We provide extensive numerical results on the optimal power flow problem, comparing our GPU-accelerated reduced-space IPM with Knitro and a hybrid full-space IPM algorithm. By evaluating the derivatives on the GPU and solving the KKT system on the CPU, the hybrid solution is already significantly faster than the CPU-only solutions. The two reduced-space algorithms go one step further by solving the KKT system entirely on the GPU. As expected, the performance of the two reduction algorithms depends critically on the number of available degrees of freedom: They underperform the full-space method when the problem has many degrees of freedom, but the two algorithms are up to three times faster than Knitro as soon as the relative number of degrees of freedom becomes smaller.},

  abstract = {This paper explores two condensed-space interior-point methods to efficiently solve large-scale nonlinear programs on graphics processing units (GPUs). The interior-point method solves a sequence of symmetric indefinite linear systems, or Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems, which become increasingly ill-conditioned as we approach the solution. Solving a KKT system with traditional sparse factorization methods involve numerical pivoting, making parallelization difficult. A solution is to condense the KKT system into a symmetric positive-definite matrix and solve it with a Cholesky factorization, stable without pivoting. Although condensed KKT systems are more prone to ill-conditioning than the original ones, they exhibit structured ill-conditioning that mitigates the loss of accuracy. This paper compares the benefits of two recent condensed-space interior-point methods, HyKKT and LiftedKKT. We implement the two methods on GPUs using MadNLP.jl, an optimization solver interfaced with the NVIDIA sparse linear solver cuDSS and with the GPU-accelerated modeler ExaModels.jl. Our experiments on the PGLIB and the COPS benchmarks reveal that GPUs can attain up to a tenfold speed increase compared to CPUs when solving large-scale instances.},

The method augments the seminal work of Dommel and Tinney with second-order derivatives to work directly in the reduced space induced by the power flow equations. In the reduced space, the optimization problem includes only inequality constraints corresponding to the operational constraints. While the reduced formulation directly enforces the physical constraints, the operational constraints are softly enforced through Augmented Lagrangian penalty terms. In contrast to interior-point algorithms (state-of-the art for solving OPF), our algorithm maintains feasibility at each iteration, which makes it suitable for real-time application. By exploiting accelerator hardware (Graphic Processing Units) to compute the reduced Hessian, we show that the second-order method is numerically tractable and is effective to solve both static and real-time OPF problems.},

In both areas, major concerns include managing the complexity of real processes, and supporting the development of general components that can be re-used within a number of different applications. Recent work in this direction is reviewed. A general mathematical statement for the combined discrete and continuous dynamic simulation problem is presented, and the use of symbolic, structural and numerical solution techniques is discussed. Methods for the diagnosis of problems that are either badly-posed or difficult to solve with currently available methods are also considered. The areas of modelling distributed parameter systems, and supporting the formal description and solution of general optimisation problems are identified as being of strategic importance for the future evolution of general-purpose process modelling environments.},

  abstract = {Today's fast-changing markets often require the granularity of production schedules to be refined to time scales comparable to the time constants of a chemical process. Consequently, the process dynamics must be considered explicitly in production scheduling. High dimensionality, nonlinearity, and the associated computational complexity make incorporating dynamic models in scheduling calculations challenging. We propose a novel scheduling approach based on scheduling-oriented low-order dynamic models identified from historical process operating data. We introduce a methodology for selecting scheduling-relevant variables and identify empirical models that capture their dynamic response to production target changes imposed at the scheduling level. The optimal scheduling calculation is then formulated as a dynamic optimization aimed at minimizing operating cost. We apply these concepts to an industrial-size model of an air separation unit operating under time-sensitive electricity prices. Our approach reduces computational effort considerably while preserving essential information required for the optimal schedule to be feasible from a dynamic point of view. Extensive simulations show that significant savings can be derived from operating in a transient regime, where the production rate is increased when energy prices are low, and reduced during peak price periods, while taking advantage of available storage capacity.}

Chemical absorption-based processes are the most mature technology, but process costs should be reduced to facilitate their worldwide application. In this context, we address the optimal design of absorption-based carbon capture technologies using the Aspen Plus platform in the equation-oriented (EO) mode. We show the efficiency of this tool by solving optimal design problems for three case studies: (i) conventional process using monoethanolamine; (ii) conventional process using 2-methylpiperazine; and (iii) advanced flash stripping (AFS) configuration using piperazine (PZ). The objective function is the carbon dioxide avoided cost, and we consider a flue gas with a CO2 concentration of 7.5\% (molar basis). Numerical results indicate that the AFS configuration with PZ has the best energy efficiency (2.46 GJ/t-CO2) and achieves the lowest CO2 avoided cost, with a value of 98.8 \$/tonne-CO2.},

The efficiency of the approach allows its application to large-scale optimization problems, with an average CPU time per run of 176 s. We additionally build surrogate models (SMs) for the capital and operating costs of the capture plants, employing an iterative procedure to generate SMs using ALAMO. We systematically reject SMs with high uncertainty in the estimated parameters. This approach results in SMs with favorable bias-variance tradeoffs, enabling their effective application to optimization problems under uncertainty, as demonstrated with a pooling problem of CO2 streams.},

In particular, we focus on parallelizing quasi-Newton interior-point methods that use limited-memory secant Hessian approximations. Such interior-point methods are known to have better convergence properties and to be more effective on large-scale problems than gradient-based and derivative-free optimization algorithms. We target nonlinear and potentially nonconvex optimization problems with an arbitrary number of bound constraints and a small number of general equality and inequality constraints on the optimization variables. These problems occur for example in the form of optimal control, optimal design, and inverse problems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations, whenever they are expressed in a ``reduced-space'' optimization approach. We introduce and analyze the time and space complexity of a decomposition method for solving the quasi-Newton linear systems that leverages the fact that the quasi-Newton Hessian matrix has a small number of dense blocks that border a low-rank update of a diagonal matrix. This enables an efficient parallelization on memory-distributed computers of the iterations of the optimization algorithm, a state-of-the-art filter line-search interior-point algorithm by W{\"a}chter et. al. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method by solving structural topology optimization problems on up to 4608 cores on a parallel machine.},

The approach aims at complementing the existing body of literature on bounding the problem via convex relaxations. It was designed for the participation in ARPA-E's Grid Optimization (GO) Competition Challenge 1. The challenge focused on a near-real-time version of the SCACOPF problem where a base case operating point is optimized taking into account possible single-element contingencies, after which the system adapts its operating point following the response of automatic frequency drop controllers and voltage regulators. Our solution approach for this problem relies on state-of-the-art nonlinear programming algorithms and employs nonconvex relaxations for complementarity constraints, a specialized two-stage decomposition technique with sparse approximations of recourse terms, and contingency ranking and pre-screening. The paper also outlines the salient features of our implementation, such as fast model functions and derivatives evaluation, warm-starting strategies, and asynchronous parallelism. We discuss the results of the independent benchmark of our approach done by ARPA-E's GO team in Challenge 1, which found that our methodology consistently produces high quality solutions across a wide range of network sizes and difficulty. Finally, we conclude by outlining potential extensions and improvements of our methodology.},

  abstract = {Optimal Power Flow (OPF) refers to a wide range of related optimization problems with the goal of operating power systems efficiently and securely. In the simplest setting, OPF determines how much power to generate in order to minimize costs while meeting demand for power and satisfying physical and operational constraints. In even the simplest case, power grid operators use approximations of the AC-OPF problem because solving the exact problem is prohibitively slow with state-of-the-art solvers. These approximations sacrifice accuracy and operational feasibility in favor of speed. This trade-off leads to costly "uplift payments" and increased carbon emissions, especially for large power grids. In the present work, we train a deep learning system (CANOS) to predict near-optimal solutions (within 1\% of the true AC-OPF cost) without compromising speed (running in as little as 33--65 ms). Importantly, CANOS scales to realistic grid sizes with promising empirical results on grids containing as many as 10,000 buses. Finally, because CANOS is a Graph Neural Network, it is robust to changes in topology. We show that CANOS is accurate across N-1 topological perturbations of a base grid typically used in security-constrained analysis. This paves the way for more efficient optimization of more complex OPF problems which alter grid connectivity such as unit commitment, topology optimization and security-constrained OPF.},

To address these challenges, there is a need to identify water scheduling patterns that improve both hydropower economics and the environment relative to current operations. This paper presents a new methodology to explore promising operational criteria/rules that can achieve such improvements. Typical environmental impact statements and relicensing processes generally perform detailed site-specific analyses of a few alternatives that focus on reservoir water release operating rules and their associated environmental impacts. In contrast, the methodology presented in this article uses a widely applicable approach that explores a much larger solution space. This large set of potential alternatives can be represented in a multidimensional space for which one axis represents the economic value and the other axis quantify individual environmental impacts (e.g., sediment transport and fish growth), and they are explored via two approaches: a Monte Carlo simulation that identifies ``win--win'' alternatives and a multi-objective optimization problem that identifies Pareto-optimal alternatives.},

  abstract = {Infinite-dimensional optimization (InfiniteOpt) problems involve modeling components (variables, objectives, and constraints) that are functions defined over infinite-dimensional domains. Examples include continuous-time dynamic optimization (time is an infinite domain and components are functions of time), PDE optimization problems (space and time are infinite domains and components are functions of space-time), as well as stochastic and semi-infinite optimization (random space is an infinite domain and components are a function of such random space). InfiniteOpt problems also arise from combinations of these problem classes (e.g., stochastic PDE optimization). Given the infinite-dimensional nature of objectives and constraints, one often needs to define appropriate quantities (measures) to properly pose the problem. Moreover, InfiniteOpt problems often need to be transformed into a finite dimensional representation so that they can be solved numerically. In this work, we present a unifying abstraction that facilitates the modeling, analysis, and solution of InfiniteOpt problems. The proposed abstraction enables a general treatment of infinite-dimensional domains and provides a measure-centric paradigm to handle associated variables, objectives, and constraints. This abstraction allows us to transfer techniques across disciplines and with this identify new, interesting, and useful modeling paradigms (e.g., event constraints and risk measures defined over time domains). Our abstraction serves as the backbone of an intuitive Julia-based modeling package that we call InfiniteOpt.jl. We demonstrate the developments using diverse case studies arising in engineering.},

Networked collections of warehouse scale computers, sometimes called Hyperscale Computing, emit more carbon than needed if operated without regard to these variations in carbon intensity. This paper introduces Google's system for global Carbon-Intelligent Compute Management, which actively minimizes electricity-based carbon footprint and power infrastructure costs by delaying temporally flexible workloads. The core component of the system is a suite of analytical pipelines used to gather the next day's carbon intensity forecasts, train day-ahead demand prediction models, and use risk-aware optimization to generate the next day's carbon-aware Virtual Capacity Curves (VCCs) for all datacenter clusters across Google's fleet. VCCs impose hourly limits on resources available to temporally flexible workloads while preserving overall daily capacity, enabling all such workloads to complete within a day with high probability. Data from Google's in-production operation shows that VCCs effectively limit hourly capacity when the grid's energy supply mix is carbon intensive and delay the execution of temporally flexible workloads to ``greener'' times.},

The method is suitable for implementation on hardware accelerators such as graphical processing units (GPUs). The current gold standard for sparse indefinite systems is the LBLT factorization where L is a lower triangular matrix and B is 1{\texttimes}1 or 2{\texttimes}2 block diagonal. However, this requires pivoting, which substantially increases communication cost and degrades performance on GPUs. Our approach solves a large indefinite system by solving multiple smaller positive definite systems, using an iterative solver on the Schur complement and an inner direct solve (via Cholesky factorization) within each iteration. Cholesky is stable without pivoting, thereby reducing communication and allowing reuse of the symbolic factorization. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach on large optimal power flow problems and show that it can efficiently utilize GPUs and outperform LBLT factorization of the full system.},

Batteries offer significant flexibility but are relatively expensive at present. Battery lifetime is a key factor in the business case, and it depends on usage, but most techno-economic analyses do not account for this. For the first time, this paper quantifies the annual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical dynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery models of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of each is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set (Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11\% to 5\% is found by increasing the model accuracy. The three models are then used within an optimal control algorithm to perform price arbitrage over one year, including degradation. Results show that the revenue can be increased substantially while degradation can be reduced by using more realistic models. The estimated best case profit using a sophisticated model is a 175\% improvement compared with the simplest model. This illustrates that using a simplistic battery model in a techno-economic assessment of grid-connected batteries might substantially underestimate the business case and lead to erroneous conclusions.},

  abstract = {Sparse direct factorization is a fundamental tool in scientific computing. As the major component of a sparse direct solver, it represents the dominant computational cost for many analyses. While the substantial computational capability provided by GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) can help alleviate this cost, many aspects of sparse factorization and GPU computing, most particularly the prevalence of small/irregular dense math and slow PCIe communication, make it challenging to fully utilize this resource. In this paper we describe a supernodal Cholesky factorization algorithm which permits improved utilization of the GPU when factoring sparse matrices. The central idea is to stream branches of the elimination tree (subtrees which terminate in leaves) through the GPU and perform the factorization of each branch entirely on the GPU. This avoids the majority of the PCIe communication without the need for a complex task scheduler. Importantly, within these branches, many independent, small, dense operations are batched to minimize kernel launch overhead and several of these batched kernels are executed concurrently to maximize device utilization. Supernodes towards the root of the elimination tree (where a branch involving that supernode would exceed device memory) typically involve sufficient dense math such that PCIe communication can be effectively hidden, GPU utilization is high and hybrid computing can be easily leveraged. Performance results for commonly studied matrices are presented along with suggested actions for further optimizations.},

By the duality, one can reduce the problem to solving a system of convex and quasi-convex inequalities. Unlike the previous developments, these conjugation functionals and dual problems are defined on the dual space and involve no extra parameter. For more general nonconvex problems, such as a quasi-convex maximization over a compact set or a general minimization over the complement of a convex set, a duality with zero gap can be obtained as well. A zero gap in primal-dual pairs allows the development of primal-dual algorithms for nonconvex problems. The primal-dual algorithms are very suitable when the dual problem is simpler than the primal one.},

We show that this ADMM-GMRES approach overcomes well-known scalability issues of Schur complement decomposition in problems that exhibit a high degree of coupling. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using linear systems that arise in stochastic optimal power flow problems and that contain up to 2 million total variables and 4000 coupling variables. We find that ADMM-GMRES is nearly an order of magnitude faster than Schur complement decomposition. Moreover, we demonstrate that the approach is robust to the selection of the augmented Lagrangian penalty parameter, which is a key advantage over the direct use of ADMM.},

However, solving the OPF problem for varying conditions within stringent time-frames poses practical challenges. To address this, operators often resort to model simplifications of varying accuracy. Unfortunately, better approximations (tight convex relaxations) are often still computationally intractable. This research explores machine learning (ML) to learn convex approximate solutions for faster analysis in the online setting while still allowing for coupling into other convex dependent decision problems.

  abstract = {As batteries become more prevalent in grid energy storage applications, the controllers that decide when to charge and discharge become critical to maximizing their utilization. Controller design for these applications is based on models that mathematically represent the physical dynamics and constraints of batteries. Unrepresented dynamics in these models can lead to suboptimal control. Our goal is to examine the state-of-the-art with respect to the models used in optimal control of battery energy storage systems (BESSs). This review helps engineers navigate the range of available design choices and helps researchers by identifying gaps in the state-of-the-art. BESS models can be classified by physical domain: state-of-charge (SoC), temperature, and degradation. SoC models can be further classified by the units they use to define capacity: electrical energy, electrical charge, and chemical concentration. Most energy based SoC models are linear, with variations in ways of representing efficiency and the limits on power. The charge based SoC models include many variations of equivalent circuits for predicting battery string voltage. SoC models based on chemical concentrations use material properties and physical parameters in the cell design to predict battery voltage and charge capacity. Temperature is modeled through a combination of heat generation and heat transfer. Heat is generated through changes in entropy, overpotential losses, and resistive heating. Heat is transferred through conduction, radiation, and convection. Variations in thermal models are based on which generation and transfer mechanisms are represented and the number and physical significance of finite elements in the model. Modeling battery degradation can be done empirically or based on underlying physical mechanisms. Empirical stress factor models isolate the impacts of time, current, SoC, temperature, and depth-of-discharge (DoD) on battery state-of-health (SoH). Through a few simplifying assumptions, these stress factors can be represented using regularization norms. Physical degradation models can further be classified into models of side-reactions and those of material fatigue. This article demonstrates the importance of model selection to optimal control by providing several example controller designs. Simpler models may overestimate or underestimate the capabilities of the battery system. Adding details can improve accuracy at the expense of model complexity, and computation time. Our analysis identifies six gaps: deficiency of real-world data in control literature, lack of understanding in how to balance modeling detail with the number of representative cells, underdeveloped model uncertainty based risk-averse and robust control of BESS, underdevelopment of nonlinear energy based SoC models, lack of hysteresis in voltage models used for control, lack of entropy heating and cooling in thermal modeling, and deficiency of knowledge in what combination of empirical degradation stress factors is most accurate. These gaps are opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Along with the rising energy consumption in the world, new technologies will influence the way we generate, distribute and consume energy. Alongside others, distributed energy generation becomes a major trend in many countries. The fast upward penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and the ongoing trend towards a more competitive electricity market requires new technologies and policies to handle both emerging technical and economic issues. In order to handle distributed generation and to intensify its visibility within power markets, the idea of virtual power plant (VPP) has emerged and is used by many researchers. It is composed of combining various small size distributed generating units to form a ``single virtual generating unit'' that can act as a conventional one and capable of being visible or manageable on an individual basis. Present paper tries to sheds light on main issues related to the idea of the VPP. The paper will review various definitions and primary concept of VPP, its main components, and finally two principal VPP types namely commercial VPP (CVPP) and technical VPP (TVPP).},

  abstract = {This paper addresses two major issues related to the convergence of generalized Benders decomposition which is an algorithm for the solution of mixed integer linear and nonlinear programming problems. First, it is demonstrated that a blind application of generalized Benders decomposition to nonconvex problems does not always lead to the global optimum for these problems; it may not even lead to a local optimum. It is shown that this happens because every local optimum of a nonlinear program gives rise to a local optimum in the projected problem of Benders. Subsequently, it is proved that a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation with zero nonlinear programming relaxation gap requires only one Benders cut in order to converge, namely the cut corresponding to the optimal solution. This property indicates the importance of tight formulations for integer programs. Examples are given to illustrate the above properties.},

Using these battery representations, we conduct a techno-economic analysis of the performance of a 10~MWh lithium-ion battery system testing the effect of a 5-min vs. a 60-min price signal on profits using real time prices from a selected node in the MISO electricity market. Results show that models of lithium-ion batteries where the power limits and efficiency are held constant overestimate profits by 10\% compared to those obtained from an enhanced representation that more closely matches the real behavior of the battery. When the battery system is exposed to a 5-min price signal, the energy arbitrage profitability improves by 60\% compared to that from hourly price exposure. These results indicate that a more accurate representation of li-ion batteries as well as the market rules that govern the frequency of electricity prices can play a major role on the estimation of the value of battery technologies for power grid applications.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for solving alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) problems using graphics processing units (GPUs). While GPUs have demonstrated remarkable performance in various computing domains, their application in ACOPF has been limited due to challenges associated with porting sparse automatic differentiation (AD) and sparse linear solver routines to GPUs. We address these issues with two key strategies. First, we utilize a single-instruction, multiple-data abstraction of nonlinear programs. This approach enables the specification of model equations while preserving their parallelizable structure and, in turn, facilitates the parallel AD implementation. Second, we employ a condensed-space interior-point method (IPM) with an inequality relaxation. This technique involves condensing the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system into a positive definite system. This strategy offers the key advantage of being able to factorize the KKT matrix without numerical pivoting, which has hampered the parallelization of the IPM algorithm. By combining these strategies, we can perform the majority of operations on GPUs while keeping the data residing in the device memory only. Comprehensive numerical benchmark results showcase the advantage of our approach.

We introduce an assumption that we call Markov embeddability that allows us to cast the stochastic optimal control problem as a policy optimization problem over the augmented state space. Then, the infinite-dimensional policy optimization problem is approximated as a finite-dimensional nonlinear program by applying function approximation, deterministic sampling, and temporal truncation. The approximated problem is solved by using automatic differentiation and condensed-space interior-point methods. We formulate several conceptual and practical open questions regarding the asymptotic exactness of the approximation and the solution strategies for the approximated problem. As proof of concept, we present numerical examples demonstrating the performance of the proposed method.},

This strategy seeks to overcome the computational challenges associated with optimal control problems that span multiple timescales. The coarsening approach uses a time discretization grid that becomes exponentially more sparse as one moves forward in time. This design is motivated by a recently established property of optimal control problems that is known as exponential decay of sensitivity (EDS). This property states that the impact of a parametric perturbation at a future time decays exponentially as one moves backward in time. We establish conditions under which this property holds for a constrained MPC formulation with linear dynamics and costs. Moreover, we show that the proposed coarsening scheme can be cast as a parametric perturbation of the MPC problem and, thus, the exponential decay condition holds. We use a HVAC plant case study with real data to demonstrate the proposed approach. Specifically, we show that computational times can be reduced by two orders of magnitude while increasing the closed-loop cost by only 3\%.},

While one way to deal with this challenge is to gradually reduce the tank temperature via an LNG, this cool-down process may also produce excessive BOG, if not properly handled, leading to a sudden pressure change inside the tank. To this end, a model predictive control (MPC) system was formulated in this work to simultaneously regulate the pressure and temperature of the tank by manipulating the vapor outlet flow rate and the amount of LNG spray injected during the cool-down process. Specifically, a high-fidelity model of cool-down process was developed and simplified to a reduced-order model (ROM). Then, the ROM was incorporated into the developed MPC scheme which successfully computed an input profile to drive the pressure and tank temperature to target values.},

SPC aims to compute approximate solutions by solving a sequence of problems with truncated prediction horizons and committing the solution in a receding-horizon fashion. While this approach is widely used in practice, its performance relative to the optimal solution is not well understood. This article reports for the first time a rigorous performance guarantee of SPC: Under stabilizability and detectability conditions, the dynamic regret of SPC is exponentially small in the prediction horizon length, allowing SPC to achieve near-optimal performance at a substantially reduced computational expense.},

Schwarz algorithms have been traditionally used to solve linear algebra systems arising from partial differential equations, but we have recently shown that they are also effective at solving structured optimization problems. In the proposed scheme, we consider QPs whose algebraic structure can be represented by graphs. The graph domain is partitioned into overlapping subdomains (yielding a set of coupled subproblems), solutions for the subproblems are computed in parallel, and convergence is enforced by updating primal-dual information in the overlapping regions. We show that convergence is guaranteed if the overlap is sufficiently large and that the convergence rate improves exponentially with the size of the overlap. Convergence results rely on a key property of graph-structured problems that is known as exponential decay of sensitivity. Here, we establish conditions under which this property holds for constrained QPs (as those found in network optimization and optimal control), thus extending existing work that addresses unconstrained QPs. The numerical behavior of the Schwarz scheme is demonstrated by using a DC optimal power flow problem defined over a network with 9,241 nodes.},

There has been a growing interest in solving multi-period AC OPF problems, as the increasingly fluctuating electricity market requires operation planning over multiple periods. These problems, formerly deemed intractable, are now becoming technologically feasible to solve thanks to the advent of high-memory GPU hardware and accelerated NLP tools. This study evaluates the capability of these tools to tackle previously unsolvable multi-period AC OPF instances. Our numerical experiments, run on an NVIDIA GH200, demonstrate that we can solve a multi-period OPF instance with more than 10 million variables up to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ precision in less than 10 minutes. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the GPU-accelerated NLP frameworks for the solution of extreme-scale multi-period OPF.

Such problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools which are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. Specifically, our framework uses a time discretization approach that: i) avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, ii) enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and iii) enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate these capabilities by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using our proposed framework (while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours). We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and easy-to-use, can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, and enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, to diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, to perform model selection, and to handle outliers.},

  abstract = {We study the optimal control of battery energy storage under a general ``pay-for-performance'' setup such as providing frequency regulation and renewable integration. In these settings, batteries need to carefully balance the tradeoff between following the instruction signals and their degradation costs in real-time. Existing battery control strategies either do not consider the uncertainty of future signals, or cannot accurately account for battery cycle aging mechanism during operation. In this paper, we take a different approach to the optimal battery control problem. Instead of attacking the complexity of a battery degradation function or the lack of future information one at a time, we address these two challenges together in a joint fashion. In particular, we present an electrochemically accurate and trackable battery degradation model called the rainflow cycle-based model. We prove that the degradation cost is convex. Then, we propose an online control policy with a simple threshold structure and show that it achieves near-optimal performance with respect to an offline controller that has complete future information. We explicitly characterize the optimality gap and show that it is independent to the duration of operation. Simulation results with both synthetic and real regulation traces are conducted to illustrate the theoretical results.},

Our lower bounds reveal that these upper bounds match up to logarithmic factors. In particular, we capture the correct signal-to-noise behavior of the problem, showing that {\textbackslash}emph\{more unstable\} linear systems are {\textbackslash}emph\{easier\} to estimate. This behavior is qualitatively different from arguments which rely on mixing-time calculations that suggest that unstable systems are more difficult to estimate.

Notably, our lower bounds rule out the possibility of a poly(log{$T$})poly(log⁡T){\textbackslash}mathrm\{poly\}({\textbackslash}log\{T\})-regret algorithm, which had been conjectured due to the apparent strong convexity of the problem. Our upper bound is attained by a simple variant of certainty equivalent control, where the learner selects control inputs according to the optimal controller for their estimate of the system while injecting exploratory random noise. While this approach was shown to achieve {$T$}--{\textsurd}T{\textbackslash}sqrt\{T\} regret by Mania et al. (2019), we show that if the learner continually refines their estimates of the system matrices, the method attains optimal dimension dependence as well. Central to our upper and lower bounds is a new approach for controlling perturbations of Riccati equations called the self-bounding ODE method, which we use to derive suboptimality bounds for the certainty equivalent controller synthesized from estimated system dynamics. This in turn enables regret upper bounds which hold for any stabilizable instance and scale with natural control-theoretic quantities.},

We show that a network of loads and DC/AC inverters equipped with power-frequency droop controllers can be cast as a Kuramoto model of phase-coupled oscillators. This novel description, together with results from the theory of coupled oscillators, allows us to characterize the behavior of the network of inverters and loads. Specifically, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a synchronized solution that is unique and locally exponentially stable. We present a selection of controller gains leading to a desirable sharing of power among the inverters, and specify the set of loads which can be serviced without violating given actuation constraints. Moreover, we propose a distributed integral controller based on averaging algorithms, which dynamically regulates the system frequency in the presence of a time-varying load. Remarkably, this distributed-averaging integral controller has the additional property that it preserves the power sharing properties of the primary droop controller. Our results hold for any acyclic network topology, and hold without assumptions on identical line admittances or voltage magnitudes.},

This paper summarizes capabilities that operational, planning, and resource-adequacy models that include energy storage should have and surveys gaps in extant models. Existing models that represent energy storage differ in fidelity of representing the balance of the power system and energy-storage applications. Modeling results are sensitive to these differences. The importance of capturing chronology can raise challenges in energy-storage modeling. Some models `decouple' individual operating periods from one another, allowing for natural decomposition and rendering the models relatively computationally tractable. Energy storage complicates such a modeling approach. Improving the representation of the balance of the system can have major effects in capturing energy-storage costs and benefits.},

We consider detailed and realistic data from the Brazilian power system to represent hourly chronological constraints based on typical days per month and year. Also, we represent the multistage stochastic nature of the optimal hydrothermal operational policy through co-optimized linear decision rules for individual reservoirs. Therefore, we ensure investment decisions compatible with a nonanticipative (implementable) operational policy. To solve the large-scale optimization problem, we propose an improved Benders Decomposition method with multiple instances of the master problem, each of which strengthened by primal cuts and new Benders cuts generated by each master's trial solution. Additionally, our new approach allows using Progressive Hedging penalization terms for accelerating the convergence of the method. We show that our method is 60\% faster than the benchmark. Finally, the consideration of a nonanticipative operational policy can save 7.64\% of the total cost (16.18\% of the investment costs) and significantly improve spot price profiles.},

It can be configured to be division-free once an initial matrix factorization is carried out, making it suitable for real-time applications in embedded systems. In addition, our technique is the first operator splitting method for quadratic programs able to reliably detect primal and dual infeasible problems from the algorithm iterates. The method also supports factorization caching and warm starting, making it particularly efficient when solving parametrized problems arising in finance, control, and machine learning. Our open-source C implementation OSQP has a small footprint, is library-free, and has been extensively tested on many problem instances from a wide variety of application areas. It is typically ten times faster than competing interior-point methods, and sometimes much more when factorization caching or warm start is used.

In both formulations, the flow dynamics are described on each pipe by space- and time-dependent densities and mass flux which evolve according to a system of coupled partial differential equations, in which momentum dissipation is modeled using the Darcy-Wiesbach friction approximation. These dynamics are first spatially discretized to obtain a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations on which state and parameter estimation formulations are given as nonlinear least squares problems.

This motivates the investigation of more efficient computational methods, especially those for solving the underlying linear systems, which typically take more than half of the overall computation time. In this paper, we present our work on sparse linear solvers that take advantage of hardware accelerators, such as graphical processing units (GPUs), and improve the overall performance when used within economic dispatch computations. We treat the problems as sparse, which allows for faster execution but also makes the implementation of numerical methods more challenging. We present the first GPU-native sparse direct solver that can execute on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs. We demonstrate significant performance improvements when using high-performance linear solvers within alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of getting significant performance improvements by executing the entire computation on GPU-based hardware. Finally, we identify outstanding research issues and opportunities for even better utilization of heterogeneous systems, including those equipped with GPUs.},

These linear systems present a challenge for existing solver frameworks based on sparse LU or LDLT decompositions. We benchmark five well known direct linear solver packages on CPU- and GPU-based hardware, using matrices extracted from power grid optimization problems. The achieved solution accuracy varies greatly among the packages. None of the tested packages delivers significant GPU acceleration for our test cases. For completeness of the comparison we include results for MA57, which is one of the most efficient and reliable CPU solvers for this class of problem.},

A significant challenge is the online computation for large-scale industrial systems. As the state-of-the-art APC technology, the Shell--Yokogawa Platform for Advanced Control and Estimation (PACE) has adopted a systematic framework of handling dynamic optimization of large-scale systems, where an automatic decomposition procedure generates subsystems for distributed MPC. The decomposition is implemented on network representations of the MPC models that capture interactions among process variables, with community detection used to maximize the statistical significance of the subnetworks with preferred internal interconnections. This paper introduces the fundamentals of such a decomposition approach and this functionality in PACE, followed by a case study on a crude distillation process to showcase its industrial application.},

This model considers different components of sustainable water resource management including economic, social and environmental aspects, and simultaneously tries to resolve conflicts between different stakeholders by means of non-symmetric Nash bargaining, which is linked to the multi-objective optimization method. This study proposes a new methodology to improve Nash Conflict Resolution through finding the optimum degree of the utility function. The proposed model is examined in the Zarrineh River basin in Iran. The results show that the amount of available resources or volume of reservoirs play a significant role in determining the optimal degree of the utility function and efficiency of the proposed method in such a way that the higher amount of resources or the larger reservoirs will result in the higher optimal degree of the utility function. In the proposed multi-objective model, two different amounts of surface water inflow are considered. The first assumed amount is the long-term average flow rate and the second one is equal to 80\% of the first mode, which is reduced based on the estimated impacts of climate changes. This multi-objective allocation model could supply 100 and 97.5\% of the environmental demand of Lake Urmia in the first and second situations, respectively.},

  abstract = {Recent increases in gas-fired power generation have engendered increased interdependencies between natural gas and power transmission systems. These interdependencies have amplified existing vulnerabilities to gas and power grids, where disruptions can require the curtailment of load in one or both systems. Although typically operated independently, coordination of these systems during severe disruptions can allow for targeted delivery to lifeline services, including gas delivery for residential heating and power delivery for critical facilities. To address the challenge of estimating maximum joint network capacities under such disruptions, we consider the task of determining feasible steady-state operating points for severely damaged systems while ensuring the maximal delivery of gas and power loads simultaneously, represented mathematically as the nonconvex joint Maximal Load Delivery (MLD) problem. To increase its tractability, we present a mixed-integer convex relaxation of the MLD problem. Then, to demonstrate the relaxation's effectiveness in determining bounds on network capacities, exact and relaxed MLD formulations are compared across various multi-contingency scenarios on nine joint networks ranging in size from 25 to 1,191 nodes. The relaxation-based methodology is observed to accurately and efficiently estimate the impacts of severe joint network disruptions, often converging to the relaxed MLD problem's globally optimal solution within ten seconds.},

  abstract = {The advent of efficient interior point optimization methods has enabled the tractable solution of large-scale linear and nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. A prominent example of such a method is seen in Ipopt, a widely-used, open-source nonlinear optimization solver. Algorithmically, Ipopt depends on the use of a sparse symmetric indefinite linear system solver, which is heavily employed within the optimization of barrier subproblems. As such, the performance and reliability of Ipopt is dependent on the properties of the selected linear solver. Inspired by a trend in mathematical programming toward solving larger and more challenging NLPs, this work explores two core questions: first, how does the scalability of available linear solvers, many of which exhibit shared-memory parallelism, impact Ipopt performance; and second, does the best linear solver vary across NLP problem classes, including nonlinear network problems and problems constrained by partial differential equations? To better understand these properties, this paper first describes available open- and closed-source, serial and parallel linear solvers and the fundamental differences among them. Second, it introduces the coupling of a new open-source linear solver capable of heterogeneous parallelism over multi-core central processing units and graphics processing units. Third, it compares linear solvers using a variety of mathematical programming problems, including standard test problems for linear and nonlinear optimization, optimal power flow benchmarks, and scalable two- and three-dimensional partial differential equation and optimal control problems. Finally, linear solver recommendations are provided to maximize Ipopt performance across different application domains.},

Optimal allocation of water resources is one of the most effective resolutions to deal with rising water demand and insufficient freshwater resources. This study proposes a fair approach for water resources allocation by employing the Sperner's lemma to solve the conflicts of different objectives and those of competing regions. A multi-objective optimal allocation model is firstly formulated to generate the Pareto frontier surface, which maximizes the economic interest while minimizing the amount of organic pollutants. Subsequently, the approach searches for acceptable allocation schemes over the Pareto frontier surfaces through the total water quantity and envy-free constraints. The proposed model is applied to the middle and lower reaches of Hanjiang river basin in China. Results indicate that water allocation between multi-region can achieve Nash equilibrium by using the water conflict resolution method to select fair water allocation schemes, in which each region obtains its preferred water quantity. The proposed approach is proved effective for water resources management in the case study and demonstrates the potential for effective application in other basins.},

Industrial demand response (DR) is an important component of demand-side management, and electricity-intensive chemical processes can both support power grid operations and derive economic benefits from electricity price fluctuations. For air separation units (ASUs), DR participation calls for frequent production rate changes, over time scales that overlap with the dominant dynamics of the plant. Production scheduling calculations must therefore explicitly consider process dynamics. We introduce a data-driven approach for learning the DR scheduling-relevant dynamics of an industrial ASU from its operational history, and present a dynamic optimization-based DR scheduling framework. We show that a class of low-order Hammerstein-Wiener models can accurately represent the dynamics of the industrial ASU and its model predictive control system. We evaluate the economic benefits of the proposed scheduling framework, and analyze their sensitivity to electricity price uncertainty.},

At one extreme, one partition per input recovers the convex hull of a node, i.e., the tightest possible formulation for each node. For fewer partitions, we develop smaller relaxations that approximate the convex hull, and show that they outperform existing formulations. Specifically, we propose strategies for partitioning variables based on theoretical motivations and validate these strategies using extensive computational experiments. Furthermore, the proposed scheme complements known algorithmic approaches, e.g., optimization-based bound tightening captures dependencies within a partition.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that fossil generators equipped with post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) systems are needed to reduce the cost of deep decarbonization. Such generators need to be flexible and responsive to grid conditions, particularly in a high variable renewable energy (VRE) environment. In this work, we evaluate the net present value (NPV) of retrofitting an existing natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) unit with a flexible PCC system while incorporating market signals from a high VRE grid. We use our industrial partner's NGCC configuration as representative of existing NGCC units and Svante's rapid-temperature swing adsorption (TSA) for PCC. Because of its ability to rapidly startup/shutdown and ramp-up/ramp-down, the chosen capture technology is very attractive for load-following operations. For a given set of market signals, we formulate a two-stage stochastic multi-period optimization problem, under the price-taker assumption, to simultaneously optimize the design of the capture system and operation of the entire plant. Rigorous models for the NGCC unit, PCC system, and compression system are developed using commercial process simulators and validated with either plant or vendor data. For computational tractability, we develop surrogate/reduced-order models for use in the optimization problem. The surrogate model for the NGCC plant is constructed by linearizing the rigorous dynamic model at 75\% load, while data-driven nonlinear surrogate models for the capture and compression systems are constructed using simulation data from the rigorous models. The optimization problem, formulated as a mixed integer bilinear program, is implemented in the IDAES{\textregistered} integrated platform and solved to global optimality using Gurobi 9.5. Using this formulation, we determine the profitability of retrofitting an existing NGCC unit with the chosen capture system for multiple regions in the U.S. under two scenarios with different carbon prices. The results show that the optimal decision strongly depends on the region and on the carbon price, thereby demonstrating the importance of the inclusion of market signals in the design process.},

  abstract = {For large systems that consider uncertainty the online solution of model predictive control problems can be computationally taxing, and even infeasible. This can be offset by using a shorter horizon, however this can in turn result in poor controller performance. In this work we consider the task of learning a convex cost-to-go to allow the use of a short, potentially single step, control horizon to reduce the online computational cost. We consider two surrogates: (1) a convex interpolating function and (2) an input-convex neural network. We highlight that irrespective of the choice of surrogate the behaviour of the surrogate near the origin and ability of the surrogate to describe the feasible region are key concerns for the closed loop performance of the new MPC problem. We address these concerns by tailoring the design of the surrogate to ensure good performance in both aspects. The paper concludes with a numerical example, showing the clear and significant reduction in computational complexity through the use of these convex surrogates.},

  abstract = {The alternating current optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problem is critical to power system operations and planning, but it is generally hard to solve due to its nonconvex and large-scale nature. This paper proposes a scalable decomposition approach in which the power network is decomposed into a master network and a number of subnetworks, where each network has its own AC-OPF subproblem. This formulates a two-stage optimization problem and requires only a small amount of communication between the master and subnetworks. The key contribution is a smoothing technique that renders the response of a subnetwork differentiable with respect to the input from the master problem, utilizing properties of the barrier problem formulation that naturally arises when subproblems are solved by a primal-dual interior-point algorithm. Consequently, existing efficient nonlinear programming solvers can be used for both the master problem and the subproblems. The advantage of this framework is that speedup can be obtained by processing the subnetworks in parallel, and it has convergence guarantees under reasonable assumptions. The formulation is readily extended to instances with stochastic subnetwork loads. Numerical results show favorable performance and illustrate the scalability of the algorithm which is able to solve instances with more than 11 million buses.},

Under certain conditions, K is quasidefinite. The Cholesky factorization \$PKP{\textasciicircum}T  = LDL{\textasciicircum}T \$ is then known to exist for any permutation P, even though D is indefinite.Quasidefinite matrices have been used successfully by Vanderbei within barrier methods for linear and quadratic programming. An advantage is that for a sequence of K's, P may be chosen once and for all to optimize the sparsity of L, as in the positive-definite case.A preliminary stability analysis is developed here. It is observed that a quasidefinite matrix is closely related to an unsymmetric positive-definite matrix, for which an \$LDM{\textasciicircum}T \$ factorization exists. Using the Golub and Van Loan analysis of the latter, conditions are derived under which Cholesky factorization is stable for quasidefinite systems. Some numerical results confirm the predictions.},

The introduction of auxiliary variables simplifies the computation of the proposal density, allowing the Metropolis--Hastings method to be applied.

We restrict our attention to the special case  for  which the target density is the product of a multivariate Gaussian prior and a  likelihood function for which the errors in observations are additive and Gaussian.

In particular, we focus on energy arbitrage, as this is a potential future large-scale application of energy storage and there is limited existing research combining the modelling of battery degradation and energy storage arbitrage. We implement two different representations of battery degradation within an energy arbitrage model, and show that degradation has a strong impact on battery energy storage system (BESS) profitability. In a case study using historical electricity market prices from the MISO electricity market in the United States, we find that the achievable net present value (at an interest rate of 10\%) for a battery system with a C-rate of 1C dropped from 358 \$/kWh in the case considering no degradation to 194--314 \$/kWh depending on the battery degradation model and assumptions for end of life (EOL) criteria. This corresponds to a reduction in revenue due to degradation in the 12--46\% range. Moreover, we find that reducing the cycling of the battery via introducing a penalty cost in the objective function of the energy arbitrage optimization model can improve the profitability over the life of the BESS.},

  abstract = {Natural gas is one of the world's leading sources of fuel in terms of both global production and consumption. The abundance of reserves that may be developed at relatively low cost, paired with escalating societal and regulatory pressures to harness low carbon fuels, situates natural gas in a position of growing importance to the global energy landscape. However, the nonuniform distribution of readilydevelopable natural gas sources around the world necessitates the existence of an international gas market that can serve those regions without reasonable access to reserves. International transmission of natural gas via pipeline is generally costprohibitive beyond around two thousand miles, and so suppliers instead turn to the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to yield a tradable commodity. While the production of LNG is by no means a new technology, it has not occupied a dominant role in the gas trade to date. However, significant growth in LNG exports has been observed within the last few years, and this trend is expected to continue as major new liquefaction operations have and continue to become operational worldwide.},

In this study, we propose a novel bi-level optimizing operation system for an LNG process, which consists of a real-time steady-state optimizer (RTSSO) and a decentralized control system. The RTSSO computes the optimal operating conditions such that the compressor power is minimized, while the decentralized control system performs real-time feedback actions to attain the target operating points against various disturbances. Special attention was given to the decentralized control system so that i) the process operation can be rapidly stabilized, and ii) the developed system can be seamlessly applied to an actual process. The performance of the proposed operation system was validated in a numerical LNG plant that precisely replicates an actual plant that produces 100t of LNG per day.},

In our proposed method, we exploit the structure of the KKT system resulting from a direct collocation scheme for approximating the DAE constraints in order to compute the necessary linear algebra operations on multiple processors. This approach is applied to find the optimal control profile of a combined cycle power plant with promising results on both distributed memory and shared memory computing architectures with speedups of over 50 times possible.},

Although MPCCs do not satisfy a constraint qualification, we establish sufficient conditions for their Lagrange multiplier set to be nonempty. MPCCs that have nonempty Lagrange multiplier sets and satisfy the quadratic growth condition can be approached by the elastic mode with a bounded penalty parameter. In this context, the elastic mode transforms MPCC into a nonlinear program with additional variables that has an isolated stationary point and local minimum at the solution of the original problem, which in turn makes it approachable by sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithms. One such algorithm is shown to achieve local linear convergence once the problem is relaxed. Under stronger conditions, we also prove superlinear convergence to the solution of an MPCC using an adaptive elastic mode approach for an SQP algorithm recently analyzed in an MPCC context in [R. Fletcher, S. Leyffer, S. Sholtes, and D. Ralph, Local Convergence of SQP Methods for Mathematical Programs with Equilibrium Constraints, Tech. report NA 210, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK, 2002]. Our assumptions are more general since we do not use a critical assumption from that reference. In addition, we show that the elastic parameter update rule will not interfere locally with the superlinear convergence once the penalty parameter is appropriately chosen.},

We show that ill-conditioning in the exact condensed matrix closely resembles that known for the primal barrier Hessian, and then examine the influence of cancellation in the computed constraints.},

  abstract = {The management of river basins is complex especially when decisions about environmental flows are considered in addition to those concerning urban and agricultural water demand. The solution to these complex decision problems requires the use of mathematical techniques that are formulated to take into account conflicting objectives. Many optimization models exist for water management systems but there is a knowledge gap in linking bio-economic objectives with the optimum use of all water resources under conflicting demands. The efficient operation and management of a network of nodes comprising storages, canals, river reaches and irrigation districts under environmental flow constraints is challenging. Minimization of risks associated with agricultural production requires accounting for uncertainty involved with climate, environmental policy and markets. Markets and economic criteria determine what crops farmers would like to grow with subsequent effect on water resources and the environment. Due to conflicts between multiple goal requirements and the competing water demands of different sectors, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework was developed to analyze production targets under physical, biological, economic and environmental constraints. This approach is described by analyzing the conflicts that may arise between profitability, variable costs of production and pumping of groundwater for a hypothetical irrigation area.},

We formulate the model by combining fundamental theories of battery degradation and our observations in battery aging test results. The model is adaptable to different types of lithium-ion batteries, and methods for tuning the model coefficients based on manufacturer's data are presented. A cycle-counting method is incorporated to identify stress cycles from irregular operations, allowing the degradation model to be applied to any battery energy storage (BES) applications. The usefulness of this model is demonstrated through an assessment of the degradation that a BES would incur by providing frequency control in the PJM regulation market.},

The proposed bidding policy considers the optimal control policy to maximize market profits while satisfying the market performance requirement through a chance-constraint. It factors the value of performance and supports a tradeoff between higher profits and a lower risk of violating performance requirements.

However, significant barriers to this optimization-based control strategy are feedback delays and consequent loss of performance and stability due to on-line computation. To overcome these barriers, recently proposed NMPC controllers based on nonlinear programming (NLP) sensitivity have reduced on-line computational costs and can lead to significantly improved performance. In this study, we extend this concept through a simple reformulation of the NMPC problem and propose the advanced-step NMPC controller. The main result of this extension is that the proposed controller enjoys the same nominal stability properties of the conventional NMPC controller without computational delay. In addition, we establish further robustness properties in a straightforward manner through input-to-state stability concepts. A case study example is presented to demonstrate the concepts.},

  abstract = {At the heart of power system operations, alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) studies the generation of electric power in the most economical way under network-wide load requirement, and can be formulated as a highly structured non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Optimization-based solutions to ACOPF (such as ADMM or interior-point method), as the classic approach, require large amount of computation and cannot meet the need to repeatedly solve the problem as load requirement frequently changes. On the other hand, learning-based methods that directly predict the ACOPF solution given the load input incur little computational cost but often generates infeasible solutions (i.e. violate the constraints of ACOPF). In this work, we combine the best of both worlds --- we propose an innovated framework for learning ACOPF, where the input load is mapped to the ACOPF solution through a neural network in a computationally efficient and reliable manner. Key to our innovation is a specific-purpose ``activation function'' defined implicitly by a QCQP and a novel loss, which enforce constraint satisfaction. We show through numerical simulations that our proposed method achieves superior feasibility rate and generation cost in situations where the existing learning-based approaches fail.},

Industrial load plays an important role in demand response because of its intense power consumption, already existing advanced monitoring, and control infrastructure, and its strong economic incentive due to the high energy costs. As typical industrial loads, cement plants are able to quickly adjust their power consumption rate by switching on/off the crushers. However, in the cement plant as well as other industrial loads, switching on/off the loading units only achieves discrete power changes, which restricts the load from offering valuable ancillary services such as regulation and load following, as continuous power changes are required for these services. In this paper, we overcome this restriction of poor granularity by proposing methods that enable these loads to provide regulation or load following with the support of an onsite energy storage system.},

This paper formulates and solves optimization problems constrained by trained graph neural networks (GNNs). To circumvent the symmetry issue caused by graph isomorphism, we propose two types of symmetry-breaking constraints: one indexing a node 0 and one indexing the remaining nodes by lexicographically ordering their neighbor sets. To guarantee that adding these constraints will not remove all symmetric solutions, we construct a graph indexing algorithm and prove that the resulting graph indexing satisfies the proposed symmetry-breaking constraints. For the classical GNN architectures considered in this paper, optimizing over a GNN with a fixed graph is equivalent to optimizing over a dense neural network. Thus, we study the case where the input graph is not fixed, implying that each edge is a decision variable, and develop two mixed-integer optimization formulations. To test our symmetry-breaking strategies and optimization formulations, we consider an application in molecular design.},

Experimental characterizations of such materials by operando microscopy produce rich image datasets3--6, but data-driven methods to learn physics from these images are still lacking because of the complex coupling of reaction kinetics, surface chemistry and phase separation7. Here we show that heterogeneous reaction kinetics can be learned from in situ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) images of carbon-coated lithium iron phosphate (LFP) nanoparticles. Combining a large dataset of STXM images with a thermodynamically consistent electrochemical phase-field model, partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization and uncertainty quantification, we extract the free-energy landscape and reaction kinetics and verify their consistency with theoretical models. We also simultaneously learn the spatial heterogeneity of the reaction rate, which closely matches the carbon-coating thickness profiles obtained through Auger electron microscopy (AEM). Across 180,000 image pixels, the mean discrepancy with the learned model is remarkably small ({$<$}7\%) and comparable with experimental noise. Our results open the possibility of learning nonequilibrium material properties beyond the reach of traditional experimental methods and offer a new non-destructive technique for characterizing and optimizing heterogeneous reactive surfaces.},

We then develop a market-based mechanism that allows for efficient co-ordination of the two systems. Importantly, the co-ordination mechanism only requires the exchange of fuel-price, -supply, and -demand information between the two markets. This can be contrasted with other co-ordination mechanisms that require operations of the two systems by a single entity. Thus, we provide a computationally tractable co-ordination mechanism that does not require the exchange of proprietary information between natural gas and electricity system operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the technique using a numerical example.},

However, as their deployments continue to rise, storage will no longer be a player on the sidelines and remain a price-taker, rather, these assets will start to impact prices. In this study, accounting for energy storage as a price-maker and using data from CAISO, we investigate strategic market behavior among competing investors using a non-cooperative game. We establish a centralized optimization problem to compute the market equilibrium. In the game, each investor initially decides on how much to invest and then how to operate their asset over a time horizon. Investors are allowed to deploy different energy storage technologies. Analytically, we show that an increasing number of investors will increase the market competition thereby reducing profits while increasing the total capacity of storage deployed. Numerically, our key findings include: (a) the difference in optimal investments under price-taker and price-maker assumptions, (b) as wind and solar assets expand under different resource-mix scenarios, there is a corresponding non-monotonic variation in arbitrage potential for energy storage, (c) when competition is intense and investors are allowed to invest in different technologies, a slight increase in storage technology performance can significantly improve an investor's profit share, (d) when the arbitrage opportunity increases with renewables, longer duration storage technologies may gain an advantage, (e) Li-ion batteries dominate the market under low-moderate renewable energy penetration or with steep energy-capacity cost reductions in the future.},

The unique characteristics of hydropower, including PSH, make it well suited to provide a range of storage, generation flexibility, and other grid services to support the cost-effective integration of variable renewable resources. The U.S. electricity system is rapidly evolving, bringing both opportunities and challenges for the hydropower sector. While increasing deployment of variable renewables such as wind and solar have enabled low-cost, clean energy in many U.S. regions, it has also created a need for resources that can store energy or quickly change their operations to ensure a reliable and resilient grid. Hydropower (including PSH) is not only a supplier of bulk, low-cost, renewable energy but also a source of large-scale flexibility and a force multiplier for other renewable power generation sources. Realizing this potential requires innovation in several areas: understanding value drivers for hydropower under evolving system conditions, describing flexible capabilities and associated tradeoffs associated with hydropower meeting system needs, optimizing hydropower operations and planning, and developing innovative technologies that enable hydropower to operate more flexibly.},

Our main result is a fast rate excess risk bound which shows that whenever a trajectory hypercontractivity condition holds, the risk of the least-squares estimator on dependent data matches the iid rate order-wise after a burn-in time. In comparison, many existing results in learning from dependent data have rates where the effective sample size is deflated by a factor of the mixing-time of the underlying process, even after the burn-in time. Furthermore, our results allow the covariate process to exhibit long range correlations which are substantially weaker than geometric ergodicity. We call this phenomenon learning with little mixing, and present several examples for when it occurs: bounded function classes for which the \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ and \$L{\textasciicircum}\{2+{\textbackslash}epsilon\}\$ norms are equivalent, ergodic finite state Markov chains, various parametric models, and a broad family of infinite dimensional \${\textbackslash}ell{\textasciicircum}2({\textbackslash}mathbb\{N\})\$ ellipsoids. By instantiating our main result to system identification of nonlinear dynamics with generalized linear model transitions, we obtain a nearly minimax optimal excess risk bound after only a polynomial burn-in time.},

  abstract = {The extensive installation of gas-fired power plants in many parts of the world has led electric systems to depend heavily on reliable gas supplies. The use of gas-fired generators for peak load and reserve provision causes high intraday variability in withdrawals from high-pressure gas transmission systems. Such variability can lead to gas price fluctuations and supply disruptions that affect electric generator dispatch, electricity prices, and threaten the security of power systems and gas pipelines. These infrastructures function on vastly different spatio-temporal scales, which prevents current practices for separate operations and market clearing from being coordinated. In this paper, we apply new techniques for control of dynamic gas flows on pipeline networks to examine day-ahead scheduling of electric generator dispatch and gas compressor operation for different levels of integration, spanning from separate forecasting, and simulation to combined optimal control. We formulate multiple coordination scenarios and develop tractable physically accurate computational implementations. These scenarios are compared using an integrated model of test networks for power and gas systems with 24 nodes and 24 pipes, respectively, which are coupled through gas-fired generators. The analysis quantifies the economic efficiency and security benefits of gas-electric coordination and dynamic gas system operation.},

  abstract = {We outline a new control system model for the distributed dynamics of compressible gas flow through large-scale pipeline networks with time-varying injections, withdrawals, and control actions of compressors and regulators. The gas dynamics PDE equations over the pipelines, together with boundary conditions at junctions, are reduced using lumped elements to a sparse nonlinear ODE system expressed in vector-matrix form using graph theoretic notation. This system, which we call the reduced network flow (RNF) model, is a consistent discretization of the PDE equations for gas flow. The RNF forms the dynamic constraints for optimal control problems for pipeline systems with known time-varying withdrawals and injections and gas pressure limits throughout the network. The objectives include economic transient compression (ETC) and minimum load shedding (MLS), which involve minimizing compression costs or, if that is infeasible, minimizing the unfulfilled deliveries, respectively. These continuous functional optimization problems are approximated using the Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) pseudospectral collocation scheme to yield a family of nonlinear programs, whose solutions approach the optima with finer discretization. Simulation and optimization of time-varying scenarios on an example natural gas transmission network demonstrate the gains in security and efficiency over methods that assume steady-state behavior.},

  abstract = {Multistage stochastic integer programming (MSIP) combines the difficulty of uncertainty, dynamics, and non-convexity, and constitutes a class of extremely challenging problems. A common formulation for these problems is a dynamic programming formulation involving nested cost-to-go functions. In the linear setting, the cost-to-go functions are convex polyhedral, and decomposition algorithms, such as nested Benders' decomposition and its stochastic variant, stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP), which proceed by iteratively approximating these functions by cuts or linear inequalities, have been established as effective approaches. However, it is difficult to directly adapt these algorithms to MSIP due to the nonconvexity of integer programming value functions. In this paper we propose an extension to SDDP---called stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP)---for solving MSIP problems with binary state variables. The crucial component of the algorithm is a new reformulation of the subproblems in each stage and a new class of cuts, termed Lagrangian cuts, derived from a Lagrangian relaxation of a specific reformulation of the subproblems in each stage, where local copies of state variables are introduced. We show that the Lagrangian cuts satisfy a tightness condition and provide a rigorous proof of the finite convergence of SDDiP with probability one. We show that, under fairly reasonable assumptions, an MSIP problem with general state variables can be approximated by one with binary state variables to desired precision with only a modest increase in problem size. Thus our proposed SDDiP approach is applicable to very general classes of MSIP problems. Extensive computational experiments on three classes of real-world problems, namely electric generation expansion, financial portfolio management, and network revenue management, show that the proposed methodology is very effective in solving large-scale multistage stochastic integer optimization problems.},
